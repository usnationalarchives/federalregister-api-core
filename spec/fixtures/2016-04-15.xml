          <P>The FDIC is correcting a Final Rule that appeared in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on July 15, 2015 (80 FR 41409), regarding Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Final Revisions Applicable to Banking Organizations Subject to the Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule (“prior <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication”). This publication corrects a technical error in the instructions to the regulatory text appearing at page 41426 of the prior <E T="04">Federal Register</E> publication, where the inadvertent omission of certain language in the instructions to the FDIC's amendatory text in § 324.403 caused the unintended deletion of § 324.403(b)(2) through § 324.403(d) as published in the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>

        <P>We are announcing the availability of a guidance for industry entitled “Exempt Infant Formula Production: Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs), Quality Control Procedures, Conduct of Audits, and Records and Reports.” Section 412(h)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&amp;C Act) (21 U.S.C. 350a(h)(1)) exempts an infant formula that is represented and labeled for use by an infant with an inborn error of metabolism, low birth weight, or who otherwise has an unusual medical or dietary problem from the requirements of sections 412(a), (b), and (c) of the FD&amp;C Act. These formulas are customarily referred to as “exempt infant formulas.” The guidance is intended to describe the significance of the regulations in 21 CFR part 106 for the production of exempt infant formulas. A final rule amending part 106 was published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on June 10, 2014 (79 FR 33057).</P>
        <P>In the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of February 10, 2014 (79 FR 7610), we made available a draft guidance entitled “Draft Guidance for Industry; Exempt Infant Formula Production: Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs), Quality Control Procedures, Conduct of Audits, and Records and Reports” and gave interested parties an opportunity to submit comments by May 12, 2014, for us to consider before beginning work on the final version of the guidance. We received one comment on the draft guidance, but the comment pertained to infant formula ingredients and not to the guidance itself. Consequently, we did not modify the guidance in response to the comment. However, we have modified the final guidance where appropriate to refer to the final rule that was published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on June 10, 2014. The guidance announced in this notice finalizes the draft guidance dated February 2014.</P>
        <P>We are issuing this guidance consistent with our good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The guidance represents the current thinking of FDA on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>In a document published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on June 13, 2012 (77 FR 35317), we announced that Gruma Corporation, Spina Bifida Association, March of Dimes Foundation, American Academy of Pediatrics, Royal DSM N.V., and National Council of La Raza (the petitioners), c/o Alston &amp; Bird, LLP, 950 F Street NW., Washington, DC 20004-1404, had jointly filed a food additive petition (FAP 2A4796). Subsequently, the March of Dimes Foundation informed us that Alston &amp; Bird, LLP, was no longer representing the petitioners and that the March of Dimes Foundation would be the main contact for the petition. The address of the March of Dimes Foundation is 1401 K. St. NW., Suite 900A, Washington, DC 20005. The March of Dimes Foundation also informed us that Royal DSM N.V. no longer was affiliated with this petition. The petition proposed that we amend the food additive regulations in <E T="03">§ 172.345 Folic acid (folacin)</E> (21 CFR 172.345) to provide for the addition of folic acid to corn masa flour (CMF) at levels not to exceed 0.7 milligrams (mg) per pound (lb) (154 micrograms (μg) folic acid/100 grams (g) CMF). The petition requested this fortification to increase the folic acid intake for U.S. women of childbearing age who regularly consume products made from CMF as a staple in their diet, including, in particular, women of Latin American descent (for example, Mexican Americans), to help reduce the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs), which are birth defects affecting the spine, brain, and spinal cord. This final rule is a complete response to the petition.</P>

        <P>Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, an important B vitamin essential to fetal development and other body functions. (Folate is the form of the vitamin found naturally in food.) It is <PRTPAGE P="22177"/>well recognized that pregnant women with folate deficiency have a higher risk of giving birth to infants affected with NTDs, specifically spina bifida and anencephaly. To reduce the incidence of NTDs, the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that all women of childbearing age consume 0.4 mg (400 μg) of folic acid daily, in addition to the consumption of naturally occurring folate from the diet. In response to this recommendation, FDA began a mandatory folic acid fortification program in 1998, requiring folic acid to be added to enriched cereal grains and cereal grain products that have a standard of identity under 21 CFR parts 136, 137, and 139 at levels ranging from 0.43 mg to 1.4 mg/lb of the finished product (61 FR 8781, March 5, 1996) (1996 final rule).</P>
        <P>Fortification with folic acid was required for enriched cereal-grain products that already had standards of identity at the time the 1996 final rule went into effect on January 1, 1998. (Standards of identity are FDA regulations that define a given food product, its name, and ingredients that must be used, or may be used, in the manufacture of the food. They were created to maintain the integrity of food products and to ensure that foods meet buyers' expectations.) Many foods do not have standards of identity, including CMF. The amounts of folic acid required in enriched cereal-grain products (bread, rolls, and buns; wheat flours; corn meals; farina; rice; and macaroni and noodle products) were specifically chosen to increase daily folic acid consumption for women of childbearing age without consumers in the general population exceeding established safe levels. In addition to mandatory fortification of these foods, folic acid may voluntarily be added at specified levels in breakfast cereal, corn grits, meal replacement products, infant formula, foods for special dietary uses, and medical foods (§ 172.345).</P>
        <P>To support the safety of the proposed uses of folic acid, the petitioners submitted dietary exposure estimates of folic acid from the proposed use in CMF, as well as all dietary sources from currently permitted uses of folic acid at levels reported in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, which represents the most current database for nutrient composition in foods, including folic acid found in fortified foods. The petitioners included intake from dietary supplements reported in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2008 datasets in their estimates. They reported exposure estimates at the median for several population groups stratified by gender, race/ethnicity, and age. The petitioners also reported estimates of the percentage of the different population groups whose intake estimates exceeded the Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) established by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) for folic acid. The IOM UL is the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population. Generally, the UL represents total intake from conventional food, water and dietary supplements.</P>
        <P>Additionally, the petitioners included over 300 scientific literature reports on folic acid published through 2012. The majority of these references concern epidemiological studies that investigated associations between folate status or folic acid intake levels and health outcomes. The petitioners included some animal studies, most of which focused on the mechanisms of action of folic acid.</P>
        <P>The petitioners also provided safety information from the 1998 IOM Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) report on folic acid (Ref. 1). In the 1998 report, the IOM established Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for folate and ULs for folic acid. The petitioners also presented safety reviews and data evaluations on folic acid that were conducted by various national health agencies: United Kingdom (UK) Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (Refs. 2 and 3); Food Standards Australia New Zealand (Refs. 4 and 5); Food Safety Authority Ireland (Refs. 6 and 7); and Health Council of the Netherlands (Refs. 8 and 9). These health agencies conducted thorough reviews of scientific papers, published through 2009, on the potential health outcomes of folic acid intake.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Evaluation of Safety</HD>
        <P>To establish with reasonable certainty that a food additive is not harmful under its intended conditions of use, we consider the projected human dietary exposure to the additive, toxicological data on the additive, and other relevant information (such as published literature) available to us. We compare an individual's estimated daily intake (EDI) of the additive from all food sources, including dietary supplements, to an acceptable intake level established by toxicological data. The EDI is determined by projections based on the amount of the additive proposed for use in particular foods and on data regarding the amount consumed from all food sources of the additive. We chose the 95th percentile of exposure as a conservative representation of habitual intake of folic acid by “high” consumers.</P>
        <P>As part of our safety evaluation of folic acid fortification in CMF, we conducted an updated literature search for relevant scientific publications from 1998 through 2015. Results of our updated literature search confirmed that the petitioners adequately covered the available published relevant safety information on folic acid, and we found only a few additional relevant publications in our search.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Acceptable Daily Intake Level for Folic Acid</HD>

        <P>In the 1993 proposed rule (58 FR 53305, October 14, 1993) and the 1996 final rule for mandatory folic acid fortification in certain foods, we adopted a safe upper limit of 1 mg per day (d) of total folate intake for the general population. This decision was based on the recommendation of the PHS that all women of childbearing age consume 0.4 mg (400 μg) of folic acid daily to reduce the risk of NTDs. The PHS further reported that total folate and folic acid consumption should be maintained at levels under 1 mg/d because high folic acid intakes could mask the signs of pernicious anemia thereby complicating the diagnosis of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency (Ref. 10).</P>

        <P>In its 1998 safety assessment, the IOM concluded that, based on the weight of the limited but suggestive evidence, excessive folic acid intake may precipitate or exacerbate neuropathy in vitamin B<E T="52">12</E>-deficient individuals and justifies the selection of this endpoint as the critical endpoint for the development of a UL (Ref. 1). In its dose-response analysis, the IOM evaluated case reports of patients with vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency who developed or demonstrated a progression of neurological complications and who had been treated with oral administrations of folic acid. The data from this analysis did not provide a no-observed-adverse-effect level. Instead, the IOM established a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) at the 5 mg/d dose based on the number of reported cases of neurological deterioration at certain doses of folic acid.</P>

        <P>An uncertainty factor of 5 was applied to the LOAEL, establishing a UL of 1 mg/d for adults 19 years and older. This UL was adjusted for children and adolescents on the basis of relative metabolic body weights and the resulting values were rounded down. For children 1 to 3 years of age, the IOM established a UL of 300 µg/p/d; for <PRTPAGE P="22178"/>children 4 to 8 years of age, the IOM established a UL of 400 µg/p/d; for children 9 to 13 years of age, the IOM established a UL of 600 µg/p/d; for children 14 to 18 years of age; the IOM established a UL of 800 µg/p/d. The IOM determined that a UL for infants could not be established because of a lack of data on adverse effects in this age group and concerns about the infant's ability to handle excess amounts of folic acid (Ref. 1).</P>
        <P>Folic acid intake of 1 mg/d is widely recognized by different international bodies as the safe or tolerable UL for adults. This UL has been used by different countries in the evaluation of their fortification policies, including Australia and New Zealand, the UK, Ireland, and the Netherlands. In a reevaluation in 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that the evidence and dose-response information on other health endpoints were not sufficient to support establishing a different UL (Ref. 11). We reviewed available updated safety and epidemiological studies published after the publication of the 1998 IOM report and found no scientific concerns that would justify revision of the current IOM ULs (Ref. 12).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Estimated Daily Intake for Folic Acid</HD>
        <P>The petitioners provided dietary intake estimates for folic acid from the proposed use in CMF and from all current dietary sources, including dietary supplements. In calculating exposure to folic acid from foods, the petitioners used food consumption data from the NHANES 2001-2002 dataset, which is based on one 24-hour dietary recall survey, and from the NHANES 2003-2008 dataset, which is based on two 24-hour dietary recall surveys. We note that estimates of nutrient exposure based on a single day of consumption do not adequately account for within-person variation in intake and can lead to underestimation of population variance, thereby underestimating the exposure (Ref. 13).</P>

        <P>In modeling folic acid exposure from fortified CMF, the petitioners identified 103 foods as containing CMF. The petitioners considered CMF as a non-whole grain and used a proxy of non-whole grains to estimate the amount of CMF in each identified food item based on the number of “ounce equivalents” of non-whole grains present in each food item. The petitioners' estimate indirectly determined the proportion of CMF present in a grain product; however, we typically use the weight (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> gram, milligram) percentage of CMF in each food item for dietary exposure assessments. Based on our review, we identified 118 foods currently available on the market that contain CMF as an ingredient. For these reasons, we conducted our own exposure estimate to folic acid for the overall U.S. population 1 year of age and older, excluding pregnant women, and various population subgroups stratified by age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and for various percentiles of intake.</P>

        <P>Specifically, we calculated total dietary exposure estimates for folic acid that included exposure to folic acid from currently fortified foods, dietary supplements, and the proposed fortification in CMF. We used consumption data from the NHANES 2003-2008 database and a method for estimating usual dietary intakes of foods and nutrients developed by the National Cancer Institute (<E T="03">http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/diet/usualintakes/method.html.</E>). Naturally occurring food folate was not included in the total folic acid exposure estimates because the IOM ULs were established for synthetic folic acid only.</P>
        <P>The NHANES survey has five race/ethnicity codes in its demographic data file. According to NHANES, this race/ethnicity variable was derived from responses to the survey questions on race and Hispanic origin. Respondents who self-identified as “Mexican American” were coded as such (Mexican American) regardless of their other race-ethnicity identities. For respondents who self-identified as “Hispanic” but not as “Mexican American” the race/ethnicity was categorized as “Other Hispanic.” Non-Hispanic respondents were categorized based on their self-reported races: Non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and other non-Hispanic races including non-Hispanic multiracial (Ref. 14).</P>

        <P>Using a statistical analysis software program (SAS®), we calculated exposure to folic acid from the proposed use in CMF by adding the daily exposure to folic acid from conventional foods to the average daily exposure of folic acid from dietary supplements. We used this software program to determine distributions of exposure (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> means, medians, percentiles) and the percentage of individuals with usual daily total folic acid whose exposure exceeded the UL (1,000 µg or other age-specific ULs). We estimated exposure for the same population subgroups for which the petitioners reported exposure in their submission in 8 age groups (1 to 3 years, 4 to 8 years, 9 to 13 years, 14 to 18 years, 19 to 30 years, 31 to 50 years, 51 to 70 years, and 71+ years), 2 gender groups (male and female), and 3 race/ethnicity subgroups (Non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH Black, and Mexican American).</P>
        <P>We estimated exposure for two scenarios. The first estimate represented a background (current) cumulative exposure of folic acid that included currently permitted uses of folic acid in conventional foods and dietary supplement use. The second estimate represented a modeled cumulative exposure of folic acid that included currently permitted uses of folic acid in conventional food, dietary supplement use, and the proposed use in CMF and products made from CMF, such as tortillas and tortilla chips (modeled). For the second scenario, we assumed a fortification level of 140 µg folic acid/100 g CMF. This fortification level was chosen to account for the petitioners' estimates of loss of folic acid during processing and storage (Ref. 13). Exposure estimates at the 95th percentile represent “high” consumers of folic acid and provide a conservative estimate of exposure.</P>
        <P>Table 1 summarizes our exposure estimates for the overall U.S. population for each of the scenarios at the median and 95th percentile of intake with the number of people represented in each age group in the NHANES survey indicated in the table:</P>

        <P>The median intakes for all age groups are well below the respective ULs. For children (1 to 13 years of age), the current 95th percentile folic acid intake estimates exceed their respective age-corresponding IOM ULs. We estimate that the addition of folic acid in CMF at the proposed level would result in a small additional increase of up to 15 µg/d of folic acid intake for this population group. Our exposure estimates at the 95th percentile for the adult population 19 years of age and older and for children 14 to 18 years of age did not exceed the IOM UL for either exposure scenario.</P>
        <P>Results from our exposure assessment demonstrate that CMF fortification would result in a slight increase in total folic acid exposure among the U.S. population. Further, as shown in Table 2, the proposed CMF fortification would result in a greater proportional increase in the median usual total folic acid exposure among Mexican Americans than among the NH White and NH Black populations. The estimated current median usual total folic acid intake of Mexican Americans is lower than that of the NH White population. Intake estimates that include the proposed CMF fortification show a larger increase for the median usual total folic acid exposure of Mexican Americans compared to the other groups, but the median intake estimate for Mexican Americans remains lower than that of NH Whites.</P>

Our exposure estimates also show an increase in folic acid intake among NH White women (214 µg/d to 221 µg/d) and NH Black women (168 µg/d to 179 µg/d) from the petitioned use of folic acid in CMF (Ref. 13).</P>

        <P>Because the use of supplements containing folic acid is a contributing factor to total exposure, we calculated usual folic acid intake for supplement non-users (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> those who did not report consuming supplements containing folic acid in the NHANES Dietary Supplement Questionnaire) and supplement users (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> those who reported consuming supplements containing folic acid).</P>

        <P>For the 51 to 70 year age group, exposure at the 95th percentile was estimated to be 1133 µg/d, representing 113 µg/d more than the adult UL of 1 mg/d (1000 µg/d). CMF fortification would further increase the 95th percentile intake by 15 µg/d, resulting in an intake estimated to be 1148 µg/d, which is 148 µg/d more than the UL.</P>
        <P>In contrast, CMF consumers who are not dietary supplement users had considerably lower folic acid exposure estimates compared to the supplement users. The 95th percentile folic acid intakes for all dietary supplement non-user age groups did not exceed their respective age-corresponding IOM ULs. While the proposed folic acid CMF fortification will increase folic acid intakes in these individuals, their modeled 95th percentile folic acid intakes remain below their respective age-corresponding ULs.</P>
        <P>The population group of users of dietary supplements with the highest percentile exceeding the UL for folic acid was children 1 to 8 years of age. For this population, exposure estimates exceed the age-specific ULs whether consumption of fortified CMF was included in the estimate or not (Ref. 13). Children are more likely than adults to exceed their age-specific UL because of their higher consumption of food and drink on a body weight basis as compared to adults. Another reason is the lower UL values established for children. We note that the ULs for children were not based on adverse effects, but extrapolated from the adult UL.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Safety of the Petitioned Uses of Folic Acid</HD>
        <P>In our safety review, we considered several potential health effects of folic acid intake that the petitioners reported in their submission. Specifically, these health effects include:</P>
        <P>• Masking vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency;</P>
        <P>• Direct effects on vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency-related neurological complications and cognitive decline;</P>
        <P>• Cancer;</P>
        <P>• Effects of prenatal exposure on childhood health outcomes;</P>
        <P>• Hypersensitivity;</P>
        <P>• Reproductive effects; and</P>
        <P>• Folic acid-drug interaction.</P>

        <P>Of these health effects, our review found suggestive evidence for masking of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency and exacerbation of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency-related neurological complications and cognitive decline. The most at-risk population for both of these potential health effects is the population 50 years of age and older. For the other health effects, the overall evidence is unclear and could not be substantiated based on the available evidence (Ref. 12).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Masking Effect of Folic Acid on Vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> Deficiency</HD>
        <P>We reviewed data from clinical case reports from vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficient patients and found that masking cases were mostly associated with pharmacological doses of folic acid (greater than 5 mg/d). There was no information in the reports to identify the lowest level of folic acid associated with the masking effect. For populations with dietary exposure to folic acid, epidemiological studies have shown mixed results and study design limitations. In a recent study in which data from the NHANES 1991-1994 (pre-mandatory fortification in the United States) and 2001-2006 (post-mandatory fortification) surveys were compared, the prevalence of low vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> status in the absence of megaloblastic anemia or macrocytosis among adults 50 years of age and older did not increase after fortification (Ref. 15). The masking effect of folic acid has been reviewed by other regulatory authorities (Refs. 2 to 9). We agree with their conclusions that folic acid intake up to the UL of 1 mg/d is not likely to mask vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency. Additionally, current medical practice does not rely primarily on the hematological index to screen for vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency (Refs. 16 to 18). Currently, the recommended testing for vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency includes analyzing for serum levels of vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> and of the metabolites, methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. Based on our exposure estimates and the incremental increase in estimated exposure from the proposed use of folic acid in CMF, we conclude that the CMF fortification at the proposed level is not likely to increase the risk of masking vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency, and that the risk of the masking effect from current and proposed levels of dietary folic acid intake is low (Ref. 12).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Direct Effects of Folic Acid on Vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> Deficiency-Related Neurological Complications and Cognitive Decline</HD>
        <P>a. <E T="03">Accelerating or exacerbating neurological complications.</E> In addition to the indirect masking effect of folic acid, there have been concerns that excess folic acid also may directly accelerate or exacerbate B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency-related neurological complications such as neuropathy. These endpoints were evaluated by IOM to determine the folic acid UL. In reviewing the historical clinical cases of neuropathy related to vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency, we noted that the rate of disease progression varied significantly among vitamin B<E T="52">12</E>-deficient patients, regardless of folic acid treatment. Because of the limited number of recorded cases, the large variability among patients at clinical presentation, and no new evidence presented after the IOM evaluation, the evidence remains suggestive as IOM stated in 1998. A definitive conclusion cannot be determined in this review whether folic acid directly enhances or worsens B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency-related neuropathy.<PRTPAGE P="22181"/>
        </P>

        <P>The potential neurological effects of high folic acid intake in children and women of childbearing age have not been thoroughly studied. However, because vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency is rare in these two populations in the United States (Ref. 19), the public health risk of this effect associated with increased exposure from folic acid fortification of CMF is likely to be insignificant.</P>
        <P>b. <E T="03">Cognitive decline among the population group ages 50 years and older.</E> Acceleration of cognitive decline among individuals who are vitamin B<E T="52">12</E>-deficient is a potential adverse health effect if undetected because of high folic acid intake. The most at-risk population for this adverse effect are consumers 50 years and older who have total folic acid intake higher than the UL. As described previously, people 50 years of age and older are unlikely to have total folic acid intake higher than the UL unless they use dietary supplements. According to an analysis in 2007, most multivitamins for seniors that contain folic acid also contain vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> (Ref. 20). Therefore, unless their vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> absorption is severely impaired due to certain diseases, individuals in this age group who have total folic acid higher than the UL are unlikely to have vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency, and thus are not at risk for this effect. Therefore, we conclude that cognitive health risks are not likely to be an issue for this sensitive population as a result of the petitioned use of folic acid in CMF (Ref. 12).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Metabolic Fate of Folic Acid</HD>
        <P>Folic acid is a water soluble vitamin that is quickly absorbed by the body. In humans, the bioavailability of folic acid is about 85 percent in fortified foods (Ref. 1). To be used as a methyl group donor, it must first be converted to dihydrofolate (DHF) and then tetrahydrofolate (THF) by the liver enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Evidence has shown that the activity of DHFR in humans is extremely low in comparison to that in rats; highly variable due to genetic polymorphism; and may become saturated when folic acid is consumed at levels higher than the 1 mg/d (Ref. 21). In addition, unlike DHF, folic acid is a poor substrate of DHFR, making the first step of metabolism rate-limiting (Ref. 22).</P>
        <P>Upon conversion, THF is distributed in all body tissues. Excretion is the main elimination route of folic acid. In response to normal intake from food, the majority of folate is effectively reabsorbed in the kidney proximal tubules and little or no folate is lost in the urine (Ref. 22). Following oral administration of single 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg doses of folic acid in healthy adults, only a trace amount appears in urine. However, after doses of about 2.5 mg to 5 mg folic acid, about 50 percent is excreted in urine as a result of exceeded renal capacity for reabsorption (Refs. 22 and 23). Therefore, a significant amount of folic acid can be excreted from urine when the renal capacity for reabsorption is saturated by high intake, eliminating excess folic acid (Refs. 22 and 24).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Conclusions on the Potential Adverse Health Outcomes From High Intakes of Folic Acid</HD>

        <P>There is some evidence linking two potential adverse health outcomes with high folic acid intake in adults: (1) Masking vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency and (2) accelerating or exacerbating neurological complications and cognitive decline among those who are vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficient.</P>

        <P>For both of these adverse health outcomes, the most at-risk population is individuals 50 years of age and older who have total folic acid intake higher than the UL. According to the results from our exposure assessment, these individuals primarily are dietary supplement users. The NHANES 1999-2002 data have established that, among the 60 years of age and older population in the United States, about 25 percent have low vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> status. Because about 10 to 30 percent of the population 50 years and older have decreased absorption of food-bound vitamin B<E T="52">12</E>, the IOM DRI report recommends that individuals 50 years of age and older obtain most of their vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> RDA, (2.4 µg/d) from vitamin B<E T="52">12</E>-fortified foods or supplements (Ref. 1). Since most multivitamins for seniors contain both folic acid and vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> (Ref. 20), their risk for vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency should be low, unless their vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> absorption is severely impaired due to certain diseases. In addition, because the currently recommended medical practice in the United States does not rely primarily on the hematological index to screen for vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency but rather serum B<E T="52">12</E> metabolites, the masking effect is less likely. Therefore, we conclude that these health risks (vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> masking and exacerbating neurological deterioration) are not likely to be an issue for this population as a result of the petitioned use of folic acid in CMF.</P>
        <P>For other potential health outcomes, such as promoting the progression of established neoplasms, childhood hypersensitivity and reproductive outcomes, the evidence is not clear but suggests further study. There may be other, as-yet unidentified potential adverse effects of high folic acid intake in children and further study is warranted. However, as previously discussed, allowing folic acid in CMF is only projected to result in a slight increase for children 1 to 13 years and 14 to 18 years of age at the 95th percentile of folic acid intake, such that there is only a marginal increase in exposure beyond the current intake levels for children.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Safety and Risk Characterization for Folic Acid</HD>
        <P>Based on the data reviewed in this safety and risk assessment on folic acid, there was no definitive association of adverse effects of folic acid at the noted levels of folic acid exposure. We do not consider that any of the intake estimates in excess of the UL in this evaluation would cause an adverse health impact on any of the population subgroups because of the following reasons:</P>
        <P>• The increase in exposure to folic acid for the studied populations from CMF fortification is small other than for Mexican Americans. For Mexican Americans, the increase in exposure is significantly larger but the resultant exposure levels are still below the levels for the general population.</P>
        <P>• The ULs were calculated using a five-fold uncertainty factor, which is approximately twice that used for other B vitamins, providing an additional margin of safety (Ref. 12).</P>
        <P>• The risk of masking vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency and related neurological complications from the estimated intake levels of folic acid is low because the most at-risk population to these health outcomes are individuals 50 years of age and older and most multivitamins for seniors that contain folic acid also contain vitamin B<E T="52">12.</E> Additionally, current medical practice does not rely primarily on the hematological index to screen for vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> deficiency but rather serum testing for vitamin B<E T="52">12</E> and its metabolites, making the masking effect less likely.</P>
        <P>• The metabolic activation of folic acid by the enzyme DHFR is slow in humans and may be saturated at doses higher than 1 mg/d.</P>
        <P>• Unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA) has no known biological function as a methyl group donor in DNA synthesis and methylation. To become active, folic acid must be reduced to THF. Excess levels of folic acid are unable to completely convert to its active form resulting in circulating UMFA. Currently there is no consistent evidence of adverse health effects causatively associated with circulating UMFA.</P>

        <P>• Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin. A significant amount of folic <PRTPAGE P="22182"/>acid is excreted from urine when the renal capacity for reabsorption is saturated by high intake, eliminating excess folic acid.</P>
        <P>• FDA's modeled intake estimates for folic acid in CMF are conservative in that they assume all CMF will be fortified with folic acid at the maximum permitted level and that manufacturing and storage losses would result in folic acid levels of 140 µg/100 g in CMF as consumed.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Incorporation by Reference</HD>

        <P>FDA is incorporating by reference the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC), 9th ed. (updated through Third Supplement, effective December 1, 2015), pp. 495-496 (the most current edition), which was approved by the Office of the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>. You may obtain a copy of the material from the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, 12601 Twinbrook Pkwy., Rockville, MD 20852, 1-800-227-8772, <E T="03">http://www.usp.org/.</E>
        </P>
        <P>The FCC is a compendium of internationally recognized standards for the purity and identity of food ingredients. Because the current regulation for the use of folic acid in food (§ 172.345) indicates that the additive must meet the specifications in the FCC, we are amending the regulation to provide for the most current edition.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Conclusion</HD>
        <P>Based on all data relevant to folic acid that we reviewed, we conclude that the petitioned use of folic acid in CMF at a level not to exceed 0.7 mg folic acid per lb. CMF is safe. Consequently, we are amending the food additive regulations as set forth in this document. Additionally, the current regulation for the use of folic acid in food (§ 172.345) indicates that the additive must meet the specifications in the FCC, 7th Edition (FCC 7). The more current FCC is the 9th Edition (FCC 9). Because the specifications for folic acid in FCC 9 are identical to those in FCC 7, we are amending § 172.345 by adopting the specifications for folic acid in FCC 9 in place of FCC 7.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Public Disclosure</HD>

        <P>In accordance with § 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that we considered and relied upon in reaching our decision to approve the petition will be made available for public disclosure (see <E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>). As provided in § 171.1(h), we will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Analysis of Environmental Impacts</HD>

        <P>We previously considered the environmental effects of this rule, as stated in the June 13, 2012, <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice of petition for FAP 2A4796 (77 FR 35317). We stated that we had determined, under 21 CFR 25.32(k), that this action “is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment” such that neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. We have not received any new information or comments that would affect our previous determination.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IX. Section 301(<E T="7462">ll</E>) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</HD>

        <P>Our review of this petition was limited to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&amp;C Act) (21 U.S.C. 348). This final rule is not a statement regarding compliance with other sections of the FD&amp;C Act. For example, section 301(<E T="03">ll</E>) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(<E T="03">ll</E>)) prohibits the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that contains a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 355), a biological product licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), or a drug or biological product for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and their existence has been made public, unless one of the exemptions in section 301(<E T="03">ll</E>)(1) to (<E T="03">ll</E>)(4) of the FD&amp;C Act applies. In our review of this petition, FDA did not consider whether section 301(<E T="03">ll</E>) of the FD&amp;C Act or any of its exemptions apply to food containing this additive. Accordingly, this final rule should not be construed to be a statement that a food containing this additive, if introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, would not violate section 301(<E T="03">ll</E>) of the FD&amp;C Act. Furthermore, this language is included in all food additive final rules and therefore should not be construed to be a statement of the likelihood that section 301(<E T="03">ll</E>) of the FD&amp;C Act applies.</P>

        <P>On March 1, 2016, BIA published an interim final rule with an effective date of April 15, 2016. 81 FR 10477. The interim final rule deletes the requirement for fee-to-trust applicants to furnish title evidence that meets the “Standards for the Preparation of Title Evidence in Land Acquisitions by the United States” issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and replaces the requirement with a more targeted requirement for title evidence, because adherence to the DOJ standards is not required for acquisitions of land in trust for individual Indians or Indian tribes. The BIA received 13 comments during the public comment period and anticipates making technical changes in response to those comments. The interim final rule stated that BIA may withdraw, initiate a proposed rulemaking, or revise the rule in response to comments. The BIA has determined that technical revisions to the rule may be appropriate and is therefore delaying the effective date of the rule for 30 days, during which time <PRTPAGE P="22184"/>BIA will publish a final rule with technical revisions.</P>

        <P>PBGC's regulation on Benefits Payable in Terminated Single-Employer Plans (29 CFR part 4022) prescribes actuarial assumptions—including interest assumptions—for paying plan benefits under terminating single-employer plans covered by title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The interest assumptions in the regulation are also published on PBGC's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.pbgc.gov</E>).</P>
        <P>PBGC uses the interest assumptions in Appendix B to Part 4022 to determine whether a benefit is payable as a lump sum and to determine the amount to pay. Appendix C to Part 4022 contains interest assumptions for private-sector pension practitioners to refer to if they wish to use lump-sum interest rates determined using PBGC's historical methodology. Currently, the rates in Appendices B and C of the benefit payment regulation are the same.</P>
        <P>The interest assumptions are intended to reflect current conditions in the financial and annuity markets. Assumptions under the benefit payments regulation are updated monthly. This final rule updates the benefit payments interest assumptions for May 2016.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU> Appendix B to PBGC's regulation on Allocation of Assets in Single-Employer Plans (29 CFR part 4044) prescribes interest assumptions for valuing benefits under terminating covered single-employer plans for purposes of allocation of assets under ERISA section 4044. Those assumptions are updated quarterly.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The May 2016 interest assumptions under the benefit payments regulation will be 1.00 percent for the period during which a benefit is in pay status and 4.00 percent during any years preceding the benefit's placement in pay status. In comparison with the interest assumptions in effect for April 2016, these interest assumptions are unchanged.</P>
        <P>PBGC has determined that notice and public comment on this amendment are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This finding is based on the need to determine and issue new interest assumptions promptly so that the assumptions can reflect current market conditions as accurately as possible.</P>
        <P>Because of the need to provide immediate guidance for the payment of benefits under plans with valuation dates during May 2016, PBGC finds that good cause exists for making the assumptions set forth in this amendment effective less than 30 days after publication.</P>
        <P>PBGC has determined that this action is not a “significant regulatory action” under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <P>Because no general notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this amendment, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>On December 18, 2015, the President signed the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015, Public Law 114-102 (HIFPA), into law. Section 102(a)(1) of HIFPA requires the President, within 120 days of the enactment of HIFPA, to prescribe regulations to prohibit or impose strict conditions on the opening or maintaining in the United States of a correspondent account or a payable-through account by a foreign financial institution that the President determines, on or after December 18, 2015, engages in one or more of the following activities: (1) Knowingly facilitating a significant transaction or transactions for Hizballah; (2) knowingly facilitating a significant transaction or transactions of a person identified on the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) maintained by OFAC, the property and interests in property of which are blocked pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) for acting on behalf of or at the direction of, or being owned or controlled by, Hizballah; (3) knowingly engaging in money laundering to carry out an activity described in (1) or (2); or (4) knowingly facilitating a significant transaction or transactions or providing significant financial services to carry out an activity described in (1), (2), or (3).</P>
        <P>Pursuant to Presidential Memorandum of March 18, 2016: Delegation of Functions Under Sections 102(a), 102(c), 204, and 302 of HIFPA, the President delegated certain functions and authorities, with respect to the determinations provided for therein, to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State. In furtherance of HIFPA's requirement and the Presidential delegation of functions and authorities noted above, OFAC is promulgating the Hizballah Financial Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 566 (the “Regulations”).</P>

        <P>Subpart A of the Regulations clarifies the relation of this part to other laws and regulations. Subpart B of the Regulations implements section 102(a) of HIFPA. The names of foreign financial institutions that are determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to engage in the activities described in § 566.201(a) of the Regulations, and which are subject to prohibitions or strict conditions on the opening or maintaining of correspondent or payable-through accounts as set forth in § 566.201(b) of the Regulations, will be listed on the Hizballah Financial Sanctions Regulations List (HFSR List) on OFAC's Web site (<E T="03">www.treasury.gov/ofac</E>) on the Counter Terrorism Sanctions page and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
        <P>Subpart C of the Regulations defines key terms used throughout the Regulations, and subpart D contains interpretive sections regarding the Regulations. Section 566.404 of subpart D of the Regulations sets forth the types of factors that, as a general matter, the Secretary of the Treasury will consider in determining, for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 566.201, whether transactions or financial services are significant.</P>
        <P>Transactions otherwise prohibited under the Regulations but found to be consistent with U.S. policy may be authorized by the general licenses contained in subpart E of the Regulations or by a specific license issued pursuant to the procedures described in subpart E of 31 CFR part 501. Subpart E of the Regulations includes a general license in § 566.504 authorizing transactions related to winding down and closing a correspondent account or a payable-through account. Section 566.504 authorizes transactions related to closing a correspondent account or payable-through account for a foreign financial institution whose name is added to the HFSR List during the 10-day period beginning on the effective date of the prohibition in § 566.201. This general license includes a reporting requirement pursuant to which a U.S. financial institution that maintained a correspondent account or a payable-through account for a foreign financial institution whose name is added to the HFSR List must file a report with OFAC that provides full details on the closing of each such account within 30 days of the closure of the account. The report must include complete information on all transactions processed or executed in winding down and closing the account.</P>

        <P>Subpart F of the Regulations refers to subpart C of part 501 for recordkeeping <PRTPAGE P="22186"/>and reporting requirements. Subpart G of the Regulations describes the civil and criminal penalties applicable to violations of the Regulations, as well as the procedures governing the potential imposition of a civil monetary penalty. Subpart G also refers to Appendix A of part 501 for a more complete description of these procedures.</P>
        <P>Subpart H of the Regulations refers to subpart E of part 501 for applicable provisions relating to administrative procedures and contains a delegation of authority by the Secretary of the Treasury. Subpart I of the Regulations sets forth a Paperwork Reduction Act notice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Participation</HD>
        <P>Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) does not apply.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Paperwork Reduction Act</HD>
        <P>With respect to section 2 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. 3507, the collection of information in § 566.601 of the Regulations is made pursuant to OFAC's Reporting, Procedures and Penalties Regulations, 31 CFR part 501, and has been approved by OMB under control number 1505-0164. See 31 CFR 501.901. The collection of information in § 566.504(b) of the Regulations has been submitted to OMB under Information Collection Request (ICR) number 201603-1505-002 and is pending approval. Section 566.504(b) specifies that a U.S. financial institution that maintained a correspondent account or payable-through account for a foreign financial institution listed on the HFSR List must file a report with OFAC that provides full details on the closing of each such account within 30 days of the closure of the account. This collection of information assists in verifying that U.S. financial institutions are complying with prohibitions on maintaining correspondent accounts or payable-through accounts for foreign financial institutions listed on the HFSR List, and the information collected will be used to further OFAC's compliance and enforcement functions.</P>
        <P>With respect to all of the foregoing collections of information, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information, unless the collection of information displays a valid control number. The likely respondents and recordkeepers affected by the new collection of information in § 566.504(b) are U.S. financial institutions operating correspondent accounts or payable-through accounts for foreign financial institutions. Because this is a new collection of information, OFAC cannot predict the response rate for the § 566.504(b) reporting requirement at this time. For future submissions, OFAC will report retrospectively on the response rate during the previous reporting period.</P>
        <P>The estimated average reporting/recordkeeping burden is 2 hours per response.</P>
        <P>Comments are invited on: (a) Whether this collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information has practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the collection of information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques and other forms of information technology; and (e) the estimated capital or start-up costs of the operation, maintenance, and/or purchase of services to provide information.</P>
        <P>Comments concerning the above information and the accuracy of these burden estimates, and suggestions for reducing this burden, should be directed to OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, with a copy to Chief of Records, Attention: Request for Comments, Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Freedman's Bank Building, Washington, DC 20220. Any such comments should be submitted not later than June 14, 2016. All comments on the collection of information in § 566.504(b) will be a matter of public record.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Size, number, and frequency.</E> The size, number, and frequency of transaction(s) or financial service(s) performed over a period of time, including whether the transaction(s) or financial service(s) is increasing or decreasing over time and the rate of increase or decrease.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Level of awareness; pattern of conduct.</E> (1) Whether the transaction(s) or financial service(s) is performed with the involvement or approval of management or only by clerical personnel; and</P>

For example, a transaction or financial service in which a foreign financial institution provides brokerage or clearing services to, or maintains an account or makes payments for, Hizballah or such a blocked person generally would be of greater significance than a transaction or financial service a foreign financial institution conducts for or provides to Hizballah or such a blocked person indirectly or in a tertiary relationship.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Impact.</E> The impact of the transaction(s) or financial service(s) on the objectives of the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015, including:</P>
                <P>(1) The economic or other benefit conferred or attempted to be conferred on Hizballah or a blocked person described in paragraph (a)(2) of § 566.201; and</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">When required.</E> If OFAC has reason to believe that there has occurred a violation of any provision of this part or a violation of the provisions of any license, ruling, regulation, order, directive, or instruction issued by or pursuant to the direction or authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this part and determines that a civil monetary penalty or finding of violation is warranted, OFAC will issue a Pre-Penalty Notice informing the alleged violator of the agency's intent to impose a monetary penalty or finding of violation. A Pre-Penalty Notice shall be in writing. The Pre-Penalty Notice may be issued whether or not another agency has taken any action with respect to the matter. For a description of the contents of a Pre-Penalty Notice, see Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Right to respond.</E> An alleged violator has the right to respond to a Pre-Penalty Notice by making a written presentation to OFAC. For a description of the information that should be included in such a response, see Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Deadline for response.</E> A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must be made within 30 days as set forth below. The failure to submit a response within 30 days shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to respond.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Computation of time for response.</E> A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice must be postmarked or date-stamped by the U.S. Postal Service (or foreign postal service, if mailed abroad) or courier service provider (if transmitted to OFAC by courier) on or before the 30th day after the postmark date on the envelope in which the Pre-Penalty Notice was mailed. If the Pre-Penalty Notice was personally delivered by a non-U.S. Postal Service agent authorized by OFAC, a response must be postmarked or date-stamped on or before the 30th day after the date of delivery.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Extensions of time for response.</E> If a due date falls on a federal holiday or weekend, that due date is extended to include the following business day. Any other extensions of time will be granted, at the discretion of OFAC, only upon specific request to OFAC.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Form and method of response.</E> A response to a Pre-Penalty Notice need not be in any particular form, but it must be typewritten and signed by the alleged violator or a representative thereof, must contain information sufficient to indicate that it is in response to the Pre-Penalty Notice, and must include the OFAC identification number listed on the Pre-Penalty Notice. A copy of the written response may be sent by facsimile, but the original also must be sent to OFAC's Enforcement Division by mail or courier and must be postmarked or date-stamped in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Settlement.</E> Settlement discussions may be initiated by OFAC, the alleged violator, or the alleged violator's authorized representative. For a description of practices with respect to settlement, see Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Guidelines.</E> Guidelines for the imposition or settlement of civil penalties or finding of violations by OFAC are contained in Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Representation.</E> A representative may act on behalf of the alleged violator, but any oral communication with OFAC prior to a written submission regarding the specific allegations contained in the Pre-Penalty Notice must be preceded by a written letter of representation, unless the PrePenalty Notice was served upon the alleged violator in care of the representative.</P>

For additional details concerning issuance of a Penalty Notice or finding of violation, see Appendix A to part 501 of this chapter.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background History and Regulatory Information</HD>
        <P>On April 30, 2016, the Wyandotte Boat Club is holding a rowing regatta in which at least 100 youth rowers will participate in a race in the Trenton Channel, a tributary of the Detroit River. Due to the projected amount of human-powered watercraft on the water, there is a need to require vessels in the affected waterways to maintain a minimum speed for safe navigation. The rowing regatta will occur between 7:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. on April 30, 2016. This event has taken place under the same sponsorship in the same location annually for the past 51 years.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary final rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment pursuant to authority under section 4(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553(b)). This provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency, for good cause, finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because doing so would be impracticable. The final details of this event were not known to the Coast Guard until there was insufficient time remaining before the event to publish an NPRM. Thus, delaying the effective date of this rule to wait for a comment period to run would be impracticable because it would inhibit the Coast Guard's ability to event participants, spectators, and other waterway users during this youth rowing regatta.</P>

        <P>Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this temporary rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>. For the same reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph, waiting for a 30 day notice period to run would be impracticable.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Legal Authority and Need for Rule</HD>
        <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority in 33 U.S.C. 1231, 33 CFR 1.05-1 and 160.5; and Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170.1. The Captain of the Port Detroit (COTP) has determined that the likely combination of recreation vessels, commercial vessels, and an unknown number of spectators in close proximity to a youth rowing regatta along the water pose extra and unusual hazards to public safety and property. Therefore, the COTP is establishing a Special Local Regulation around the event location to help minimize risks to safety of life and property during this event.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Discussion of Rule</HD>
        <P>This rule establishes a temporary special local regulation from 7:30 a.m. until 3 p.m. on April 30, 2016. In light of the aforementioned hazards, the COTP has determined that a special local regulation is necessary to protect spectators, vessels, and participants. The special local regulation will encompass the following waterway: All waters of the Detroit River, Trenton Channel between the following two lines going from bank-to-bank: The first line is drawn directly across the channel from position 42°11.0′ N., 083°09.4′ W. (NAD 83); the second line, to the north, is drawn directly across the channel from position 42°11.7′ N., 083°8.9′ W. (NAD 83).</P>
        <P>An on-scene representative of the COTP or event sponsor representatives may permit vessels to transit the area when no race activity is occurring. The on-scene representative may be present on any Coast Guard, state or local law enforcement vessel assigned to patrol the event. Vessel operators desiring to transit through the regulated area must contact the Coast Guard Patrol Commander to obtain permission to do so. The COTP or his designated on-scene representative may be contacted via VHF Channel 16.</P>
        <P>The COTP or his designated on-scene representative will notify the public of the enforcement of this rule by all appropriate means, including a Broadcast Notice to Mariners and Local Notice to Mariners.</P>

        <P>This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, as supplemented by E.O. 13563, Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review, and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of Executive Order 12866 or under section 1 of E.O. 13563. The Office of Management and Budget has not reviewed it under those Orders.</P>
        <P>We conclude that this rule is not a significant regulatory action because we anticipate that it will have minimal impact on the economy, will not interfere with other agencies, will not adversely alter the budget of any grant or loan recipients, and will not raise any novel legal or policy issues.</P>
        <P>The Coast Guard's use of this special local regulation will be of relatively small size and only seven and a half hours in duration, and it is designed to minimize the impact on navigation. Moreover, vessels may transit through the area affected by this special local regulation at a minimum speed for safe navigation. Overall, the Coast Guard expects minimal impact to vessel movement from the enforcement of this special local regulation.</P>

The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
        <P>This rule will affect the following entities, some of which might be small entities: The owners or operators of vessels intending to transit or anchor in this portion of the Detroit River, Trenton Channel in the vicinity of Wyandotte, MI between 7:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. on April 30, 2016.</P>

        <P>This special local regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for the reasons cited in the <E T="03">Regulatory Planning and Review</E> section. Additionally, before the enforcement of the regulation, Coast Guard Sector Detroit will issue a local Broadcast Notice to Mariners so vessel owners and operators can plan accordingly.</P>

        <P>Conrail, owner of the Delair Bridge, has requested a temporary deviation from the current operating regulation to perform urgent repairs by replacing wire ropes connecting the counterweights and the lift span. The bridge is a vertical lift-span bridge and has a vertical clearance in the closed position of 49 feet above mean high water.</P>
        <P>The current operating schedule is set out in 33 CFR 117.716. Under this temporary deviation, the bridge will remain in the closed-to-navigation position from 5 a.m. April 30, 2016 to 5 a.m. May 7, 2016; from 5 a.m. May 14, 2016 to 5 a.m. May 21, 2016; and from 5 a.m. June 4, 2016 to 5 a.m. June 11, 2016. The lift span will not be able to open since one counterweight will be detached until the end of the repair work.</P>
        <P>Vessels able to pass through the bridge in the closed position may do so at anytime. The bridge will not be able to open for emergencies and there is no immediate alternate route for vessels unable to pass through the bridge in the closed position. The rope replacement construction schedule was developed through the coordination with Coast Guard Sector Delaware Bay and the Mariners' Advisory Committee for the Bay and River Delaware (MAC). The Coast Guard will also inform the users of the waterways through our Local and Broadcast Notices to Mariners of the change in operating schedule for the bridge so that vessel operators can arrange their transits to minimize any impact caused by the temporary deviation.</P>
        <P>In accordance with 33 CFR 117.35 (e), the drawbridge must return to its regular operating schedule immediately at the end of the effective period of this temporary deviation. This deviation from the operating regulations is authorized under 33 CFR 117.35.</P>

          <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notifying the public that the Agency has found that the motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs or “budgets”) for the years 2014 and 2017 in the San Joaquin Valley Moderate Area Plan, as revised in a <PRTPAGE P="22195"/>December 29, 2014 submittal, for the 2006 24-hour fine particulate (PM<E T="52">2.5</E>) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) are adequate for transportation conformity purposes. The Moderate Area Plan was submitted to the EPA on March 4, 2013 by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) as a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) and includes a demonstration of reasonable further progress for the 2006 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS. CARB submitted a Supplement to the Moderate Area Plan on November 6, 2014 (“2014 Supplement”) and a revision to the budgets on December 29, 2014. We refer to these submittals collectively as the “2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan” or “Plan.” Upon the effective date of this notice of adequacy, the San Joaquin Valley metropolitan planning organizations (MPO) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) must use these budgets for future transportation conformity determinations.</P>

        <P>This action is simply an announcement of a finding that we have already made. EPA Region IX sent a letter to CARB on April 1, 2016 stating that the motor vehicle emissions budgets in the submitted 2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan for the reasonable further progress (RFP) milestone years of 2014 and 2017 are adequate.</P>

          <FTREF/> We received two comments on the budgets.<SU>3</SU>

          <FTREF/> We respond to the first of these two comments below.

We will respond to this comment when we take final action on the interpollutant trading mechanism as part of our final action on the 2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan and 2014 Supplement. The interpollutant trading mechanism cannot be used until it is approved as part of the SIP. Therefore, the appropriate venue for responding to the comment on the trading mechanism is the final rule on the 2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan and 2014 Supplement.</P>

        <P>Transportation conformity is required by Clean Air Act section 176(c). The EPA's conformity rule requires that transportation plans, transportation improvement programs, and projects conform to a SIP and establishes the criteria and procedures for determining whether or not they do. Conformity to a SIP means that transportation activities will not produce new air quality violations, worsen existing violations, or delay timely attainment of the NAAQS.</P>
        <P>The criteria by which we determine whether a SIP's MVEBs are adequate for conformity purposes are outlined in 40 CFR 93.118(e)(4) which was promulgated in our August 15, 1997 final rule (62 FR 43780 at 43781-43783). We have further described our process for determining the adequacy of submitted SIP MVEBs in our July 1, 2004 final rule (69 FR 40004 at 40038), and we used the information in these resources in making our adequacy determination. Please note that an adequacy review is separate from the EPA's completeness review and should not be used to prejudge the EPA's ultimate action on the SIP. Even if we find a budget adequate, the SIP could later be disapproved.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Response to Comment</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Comment:</E> Earthjustice asserts that the EPA must disapprove the RFP demonstration in the 2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan and 2014 Supplement because it does not adequately address ammonia emission reductions and, therefore, does not provide “such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required . . . for the purpose of ensuring attainment . . . by the applicable date.” Earthjustice argues that, because the RFP demonstration is not approvable, the EPA cannot find that the motor vehicle emissions budgets in the 2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan and 2014 Supplement are consistent with applicable requirements for reasonable further progress, as required by 40 CFR 98.118(e)(4)(iv).</P>

          <E T="03">Response:</E> On January 13, 2015, the EPA proposed to approve several elements of the 2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan and 2014 Supplement, which California submitted to address Clean Air Act requirements for the 2006 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS in the San Joaquin Valley.<SU>4</SU>

          <FTREF/> As part of this action, the EPA proposed to approve the Plan's RFP demonstration for 2014 and 2017, based on a conclusion that the 2014 and 2017 emissions projections for direct PM<E T="52">2.5</E>, nitrogen oxides (NO<E T="52">X</E>), sulfur dioxide (SO<E T="52">2</E>), and ammonia (NH<E T="52">3</E>) reflect full implementation of the State's and District's Reasonably Available Control Measures/Reasonably Available Control Technology control strategy, which achieves substantial reductions in emissions of each of these pollutants over the period covered by the Plan. <E T="03">Id.</E> at 1835-37. The EPA also proposed to approve the direct PM<E T="52">2.5</E> and NO<E T="52">X</E> MVEBs for 2014 and 2017, based on a conclusion that these MVEBs are consistent with applicable requirements for reasonable further progress and the other adequacy requirements. <E T="03">Id.</E> at 1838-41. Finally, in accordance with 40 CFR 93.102(b)(2)(v), the EPA proposed to find that on-road emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC), SO<E T="52">2</E>, and NH<E T="52">3</E> are not significant contributors to the PM<E T="52">2.5</E> nonattainment problem in the SJV area, and accordingly, that transportation conformity requirements do not apply for these pollutants in this area. <E T="03">Id.</E> at 1840.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>In PM<E T="52">2.5</E> nonattainment areas, the transportation conformity provisions of 40 CFR part 93, subpart A, apply with respect to emissions of VOC, SO<E T="52">2</E> and/or NH<E T="52">3</E> if the EPA Regional Administrator or the director of the state air agency has made a finding that on-road emissions of any of these precursors within the nonattainment area are a significant contributor to the PM<E T="52">2.5</E> nonattainment problem and has so notified the MPO and DOT, or if the applicable implementation plan (or implementation plan submission) establishes an approved (or adequate) budget for such emissions as part of the reasonable further progress, attainment or maintenance strategy. 40 CFR 93.102(b)(2)(v). With respect to VOC, SO<E T="52">2</E>, and NH<E T="52">3</E>, neither the EPA nor the State has made a finding that on-road emissions of any of these precursors are <PRTPAGE P="22196"/>a significant contributor to the PM<E T="52">2.5</E> nonattainment problem in the SJV area, and neither the approved California SIP nor the submitted 2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan and 2014 Supplement establish adequate MVEBs for such emissions as part of an RFP, attainment or maintenance strategy for the PM<E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS. Accordingly, the transportation conformity provisions of 40 CFR part 93, subpart A, do not apply with respect to emissions of VOC, SO<E T="52">2</E> or NH<E T="52">3</E> for purposes of the 2006 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS in the SJV.</P>

        <P>The provisions of 40 CFR part 93, subpart A, apply with respect to emissions of NO<E T="52">X</E> because neither the EPA nor the State has made a finding that on-road emissions of NO<E T="52">X</E> within the SJV nonattainment are not a significant contributor to the PM<E T="52">2.5</E> nonattainment problem, and because the 2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan and 2014 Supplement establish adequate budgets for such emissions as part of the Plan's RFP strategy. 40 CFR 93.102(b)(2)(iv). The provisions of 40 CFR part 93, subpart A, also apply with respect to emissions of direct PM<E T="52">2.5</E> because PM<E T="52">2.5</E> is a criteria pollutant identified in 40 CFR 93.102(b)(1).</P>

        <P>In order to find an MVEB in a submitted control strategy implementation plan revision to be adequate for transportation conformity purposes, the EPA must find, among other things, that the motor vehicle emissions budget(s), when considered together with all other emission sources, is consistent with applicable requirements for reasonable further progress, attainment, or maintenance (whichever is relevant to the given plan). 40 CFR 93.118(e)(4)(iv). Because the provisions of 40 CFR part 93, subpart A, apply only with respect to emissions of NO<E T="52">X</E> and direct PM<E T="52">2.5</E> for purposes of the 2006 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> NAAQS in the SJV area, we have evaluated the submitted NO<E T="52">X</E> and direct PM<E T="52">2.5</E> MVEBs for consistency with our adequacy criteria in § 93.118(e)(4). The commenter's arguments about NH<E T="52">3</E> emissions are not germane to our evaluation of the MVEBs under these adequacy criteria.</P>

        <P>As explained in our January 13, 2015 proposed rule, the 2014 and 2017 MVEBs for NO<E T="52">X</E> and direct PM<E T="52">2.5</E> in the 2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan and 2014 Supplement are consistent with the RFP demonstration with respect to these pollutants in the submitted plan. We find, therefore, that these MVEBs meet the requirement in 40 CFR 93.118(e)(4) for consistency with applicable requirements for RFP in the submitted plan. We note that our adequacy review is a cursory review of the SIP and MVEBs to ensure that the minimum adequacy criteria are met before a submitted budget is used in a conformity determination. This adequacy finding should not be used to prejudge the EPA's final rulemaking action on the SIP.</P>

        <P>In summary, we are announcing our finding that the motor vehicle emissions budgets for the years 2014 and 2017 from the 2012 PM<E T="52">2.5</E> Plan are adequate for transportation conformity purposes. The finding is available at the EPA's conformity Web site: <E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/otaq/stateresources/transconf/adequacy.htm</E>. The adequate MVEBs are provided in the following table:</P>

          <P>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is proposing to amend its Bid Protest Regulations, promulgated in accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA), to implement the requirements in sec. 1501 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which was enacted on January 14, 2014, and to make certain administrative changes. The proposed amendments implement the legislation's direction to establish and operate an electronic filing and document dissemination system for the filing of bid protests with GAO. At this time, GAO believes that these proposed revisions are the only regulatory changes necessary to implement the statutory requirement of sec. 1501. The proposed amendments also include administrative changes to reflect current practice and to streamline the bid protest process.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Comments Invited</HD>
        <P>GAO is not subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and accordingly is not required by law to seek comments before issuing a final rule. However, GAO has decided to invite written comments regarding the proposed revisions. Application of the Administrative Procedures Act to GAO is not to be inferred from this invitation for comments. GAO will consider all comments received on or before the closing date for comments. GAO may change the proposed revisions based on the comments received.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>GAO determined to undertake these revisions to GAO's Bid Protest Regulations as the result of a statutory requirement imposed by the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2014, Public Law 113-76, 128 Stat. 5 (Jan. 14, 2014). Section 1501 of this act directs GAO to establish and operate an electronic filing and document dissemination system, “under which, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Comptroller General—(A) a person filing a protest under this subchapter may file the protest through electronic means; and (B) all documents and information required with respect to the protest may be disseminated and made available to the parties to the protest through electronic means.” Public Law 113-76, div. I, title I, sec. 1501, 128 Stat. 5, 433-34 (Jan. 17, 2014). At the time of this proposed rule, GAO is developing the system, which will be called the Electronic Protest Docketing System (EPDS). EPDS will be the sole means for filing a bid protest at GAO (with the exception of protests containing classified information), and will enable parties to a bid protest and GAO to file and receive documents. Additional guidance for the use of EPDS will be provided by GAO, separate from the regulations in 4 CFR part 21.</P>
        <P>In addition to directing GAO to establish and operate an electronic filing and document dissemination system, sec. 1501 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2014 authorizes GAO to “require each person who files a protest under this subchapter to pay a fee to support the establishment and operation of the electronic system under this subsection.” Public Law 113-76, div. I, title I, sec. 1501, 128 Stat. 5, 434 (Jan. 17, 2014). GAO anticipates requiring persons filing a protest to pay a fee to file a protest through EPDS, which, as discussed above, will be the sole means for filing a bid protest at GAO. Additional guidance regarding procedures for payment of the fee will be provided by GAO, separate from the regulations in 4 CFR part 21.</P>
        <P>GAO anticipates the bid protest filing fee will be $350. GAO derived the fee using actual costs GAO has incurred to develop the system, estimates of future costs for hosting and maintaining the system (adjusted for inflation), estimates of future annual bid protest filings as determined by considering historical filings of the past five fiscal years, and a recovery period for development costs of approximately six years. System establishment costs include payments made by GAO under an interagency agreement for development of the system, as well as GAO's internal costs incurred for system development. Costs to maintain the system include estimated payments for post-development hosting and support of the electronic protest filing system, as well as estimates of GAO's internal costs associated with maintaining the system after it has been deployed. All fees collected will be maintained in a separate account established by GAO. The fee will be reviewed every two years to ensure that it is properly calibrated to recover the costs of establishing and maintaining the system.</P>
        <P>The proposed revisions to GAO's Bid Protest Regulations to implement sec. 1501 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2014 and to make certain administrative changes to reflect current practice and to streamline the bid protest process are set forth below:</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Interested Party</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (a)(2) of 4 CFR 21.0 to clarify that the Office of Management and Budget should be abbreviated as “OMB.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Federal Agency or Agency</HD>

        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (c) of 4 CFR 21.0 to change a reference to <PRTPAGE P="22198"/>the Architect of the Capitol to be gender-neutral.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Electronic Protest Docket System (EPDS)</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to redesignate paragraph (f) of 4 CFR 21.0 as paragraph (g), redesignate paragraph (g) as paragraph (h), and add a new paragraph (f). Revised paragraph (f) defines EPDS as GAO's web-based electronic docketing system. In the final rule, GAO will provide a Web site where additional guidance regarding the EPDS may be found.</P>
        <P>To clarify how a document is “filed” under GAO's Bid Protest Regulations, GAO proposes to revise redesignated paragraph (g) to specify that EPDS is the sole method for filing a document with GAO for a bid protest (with the exception of protests containing classified material, as explained in a sentence added to the revised paragraph (h) of 4 CFR 21.1). The proposed revisions throughout this proposed rule reflect that all filings are presumed to be made through EPDS (with the exception of protests containing classified material), which will enable the parties and GAO to file and receive documents.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Filing a Protest</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (b) of 4 CFR 21.1 to specify that EPDS will be the sole means for filing a bid protest at GAO.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (c)(1) of 4 CFR 21.1 to ensure a consistent reference to the term “email.”</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise the last sentence of paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.1 to reflect the requirement in redesignated paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.0 that documents must be filed through EPDS.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to add a sentence to paragraph (h) of 4 CFR 21.1 to reflect that documents containing classified material may not be filed through EPDS.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Time for Filing a Protest</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to add a sentence to paragraph (a)(1) of 4 CFR 21.2 to clarify the time for filing challenges to a solicitation where the basis for a protest becomes known when there is no solicitation closing date or when no further submissions in response to the solicitation are anticipated. Such protests must be filed within 10 days of when the alleged impropriety was known or should have been known.</P>

        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (a)(2) of 4 CFR 21.2 to clarify that the 10-day “safe-harbor” provision in paragraph (a)(2) (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the provision in paragraph (a)(2) establishing that protests challenging a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held) does not apply to protests challenging alleged solicitation improprieties covered by paragraph (a)(1) of 4 CFR 21.2. This clarification resolves a potential uncertainty in 4 CFR 21.2(a)(2) that was addressed by GAO in a recent decision, <E T="03">Protect the Force, Inc.—Recon.,</E> B-411897.3, Sept. 30, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 306, wherein we denied the protester's request to reconsider our dismissal of its protest challenging the terms of a solicitation as untimely. The protest was filed within 10 days of a requested and required debriefing, but more than 10 days after the agency allegedly revised its solicitation. Because the solicitation did not establish a new closing date, we concluded that the challenge to the terms of the solicitation was required to be filed within 10 days of the revision to the solicitation. We concluded that the outcome in the prior dismissal was consistent with our decision in <E T="03">Armorworks Enters., LLC,</E> B-400394, B-400394.2, Sept. 23, 2008, 2008 CPD ¶ 176 at 6, and the principles enunciated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <E T="03">Blue &amp; Gold Fleet, L.P.</E> v.<E T="03"> United States,</E> 492 F.3d 1308, 1313-14 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The revision here is to ensure that paragraph (a)(2) of 4 CFR 21.2 expressly reflects our decision in <E T="03">Protect the Force, Inc.—Recon.</E>
        </P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (a)(3) of 4 CFR 21.2 to make a minor phrasing change for purposes of consistency to the requirement that protests to GAO following agency-level protests must be filed within 10 days of actual or constructive knowledge of initial adverse agency action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Communications Among Parties</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise the heading of 4 CFR 21.3.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (a) of 4 CFR 21.3 to make minor phrasing changes for purposes of consistency, and to reflect the requirement in redesignated paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.0 that documents must be filed through EPDS. Revised paragraph (a) also requires that parties to a protest must provide copies of all communications with the agency or other parties to the protest to the other participating parties either through EPDS or email. When the final rule is published GAO will provide a link to a GAO Web site in revised paragraph (a) that will provide information concerning when communications must be made through EPDS or email.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Submission of Agency Report</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (c) of 4 CFR 21.3 to reflect the requirement in redesignated paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.0 that documents must be filed through EPDS. Revised paragraph (c) also clarifies that if the fifth day for filing the agency's required response to a protester's request for documents falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the response shall be filed on the last business day that precedes the weekend or federal holiday.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (d) of 4 CFR 21.3 to reflect the requirement in redesignated paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.0 that documents must be filed through EPDS. Revised paragraph (d) also deletes the requirement for the agency report to include a copy of the protest, as this document will have already been provided to all parties.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (e) of 4 CFR 21.3 to provide that where a protester or intervenor does not have counsel admitted to a protective order, and documents are withheld from the protester or intervenor on that basis, the agency must provide appropriately-redacted documents that adequately inform the protester or intervenor of the basis for the agency's arguments in response to the protest. In the final rule, the revised paragraph (e) will provide a link to a GAO Web site that provides information concerning filing of documents when no protective order is issued, or where a protester or intervenor is not admitted to a protective order.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Additional Documents</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (f) of 4 CFR 21.3 to reflect the requirement in redesignated paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.0 that documents must be filed through EPDS. Paragraph (f) is also revised to make minor phrasing changes, consistent with the proposed revisions in paragraph (c) of 4 CFR 21.3.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraphs (g) and (h) of 4 CFR 21.3 to reflect the requirement in redesignated paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.0 that documents must be filed through EPDS.</P>

        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (i) of 4 CFR 21.3 by replacing the previous section with new paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2), and (i)(3), to clarify the time when comments on the agency report must be filed. New paragraph (i)(1) provides that comments on the agency report must be filed within 10 days after the agency files the report, unless GAO establishes a shorter period of time or grants an extension. New paragraph (i)(2) <PRTPAGE P="22199"/>provides that a protest shall be dismissed if the protester does not file comments within the period of time established in revised paragraph (i)(1). New paragraph (i)(3) provides that a protest allegation or argument shall be dismissed where the agency report responds to the allegation or argument, but the protester's comments do not address the agency's response. New paragraph (i)(3) reflects a longstanding practice by GAO, described in numerous GAO bid protest decisions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Protective Orders</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (a) of 4 CFR 21.4 to reflect that GAO generally does not issue a protective order where an intervenor retains counsel, but the protester does not. This revision reflects GAO's longstanding practice of generally permitting the protester's decision whether to retain counsel to dictate whether GAO will issue a protective order. This practice is consistent with GAO's statutory mandate to provide for an inexpensive protest forum. 31 U.S.C. 3554(a)(1). Notwithstanding this general practice, GAO may, if circumstances warrant, issue a protective order where the protester is not represented by counsel.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to redesignate paragraph (b) of 4 CFR 21.4 as paragraph (c), redesignate paragraph (c) as paragraph (d), redesignate paragraph (d) as paragraph (e), and add a new paragraph (b). New paragraph (b) provides that when parties file documents that are covered by a protective order, the parties must provide copies of proposed redacted versions of the document to the other parties. Proposed redacted versions of documents should not be filed in EPDS; rather, the party responsible for preparing the proposed redacted version of the document should provide the document to the other parties by email or facsimile. New paragraph (b) provides that, where appropriate, the exhibits to the agency report or other documents may be proposed for redaction in their entirety. New paragraph (b) also provides that the party that files the protected document must file in EPDS within 5 days a final, agreed-to redacted version of the document. New paragraph (b) also directs the parties to seek GAO's resolution of any disputes concerning redacted documents.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise redesignated paragraph (c) of 4 CFR 21.4, to reflect the requirements of revised paragraph (e) of 4 CFR 21.3.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise redesignated paragraph (d) of 4 CFR 21.4, to reflect the requirement in redesignated paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.0 that documents must be filed through EPDS.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Protest Issues Not for Consideration</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (a) of 4 CFR 21.5 to reflect the recodification of statutory provisions in Title 41 of the United States Code.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (b) of 4 CFR 21.5 to make consistent references to the Small Business Administration (SBA). GAO proposes to revise paragraph (d) of 4 CFR 21.5 to reflect the recodification of statutory provisions in Title 41 of the United States Code.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (e) of 4 CFR 21.5 to revise the term “in GAO” to “with GAO.”</P>

        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.5 to reflect the recodification of statutory provisions in Title 40 of the United States Code.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (h) of 4 CFR 21.5 to reflect the requirement in redesignated paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.0 that documents must be filed through EPDS.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to add paragraph (<E T="03">l</E>) to 4 CFR 21.5 to reflect that, under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2304(e)(1) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)(1), GAO does not have jurisdiction to review protests of orders issued under task or delivery order contracts where the order is valued at less than $10 million, unless it is alleged that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order was issued. At the time of this proposed rule, the provisions concerning procurements under Title 10 are permanent. The provisions concerning procurements under Title 41, however, are subject to a sunset clause, under which GAO's jurisdiction to hear protests over $10 million will no longer be in effect after September 30, 2016. 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)(1).</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to add paragraph (m) to 4 CFR 21.5 to clarify GAO's review of awards that are not procurement contracts. Proposed new paragraph (m) reflects GAO's longstanding view that GAO's statutory jurisdiction under CICA does not include the review of protests of awards, or solicitations for awards, or of agreements other than procurement contracts, with the exception of instances where an agency has agreed in writing to have nonstatutory protests decided by GAO, as described in 4 CFR 21.13. The new paragraph (m) proposes to clarify that GAO reviews protests that an agency is improperly using a nonprocurement instrument.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Withholding of Award and Suspension of Contract Performance</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise 4 CFR 21.6 to require agencies to file a notification where it overrides a statutory requirement to withhold award or suspend contract performance and to require agencies to file any issued determination. 31 U.S.C. 3553(c)(2)(B), (d)(3)(C)(ii). GAO previously did not require this information, but believes it is necessary to implement our statutory requirement, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3554(b)(2), to consider the basis for an agency's override in determining the remedy to recommend in the event GAO sustains a protest, as provided in paragraph (c) of 4 CFR 21.8.</P>

        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (a) of 4 CFR 21.7 to reflect the requirement in redesignated paragraph (g) of 4 CFR 21.0 that documents must be filed through EPDS.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (e) of 4 CFR 21.7 to reflect GAO's longstanding practice of not providing hearing transcripts, but permitting the parties to provide for transcription of a hearing as long as a copy of such transcript is provided to GAO at the parties' expense.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Remedies</HD>
        <P>GAO proposed to add new headings to paragraphs (e) and (f) which will distinguish the different remedial recommendations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Recommendation for Reimbursement of Costs</HD>

        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (e) of 4 CFR 21.8 to provide more specific guidance regarding recommendations for reimbursement of protest costs. Revised paragraph (e) requires the agency to file a response to the request within 15 days after the request is filed. The prior version of paragraph (e) provided that the agency “may” respond within 15 days. This change is intended to allow the agency to either agree to the request, which eliminates the need for GAO to issue a decision, or to provide a specific basis for the agency's objection to the request, upon which the protester must comment. Revised paragraph (e) also requires the protester to file comments on the agency's response within 10 days, and further provides that GAO will dismiss the request if the protester fails to file comments within 10 days. This change is intended to provide an adequate record for GAO to review in issuing its decision, and also reflects that GAO will not issue a decision where the protester effectively abandons its request by <PRTPAGE P="22200"/>failing to comment on the agency's response.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Recommendation on the Amount of Costs</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to add a heading to paragraph (f) of 4 CFR 21.8 to highlight specific guidance regarding recommendations on the amount of costs to be reimbursed.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (f)(2) by moving the discussion of disagreements between the agency and protester to revised paragraph (f)(3) for purposes of clarity.</P>
        <P>New paragraph (f)(3) reflects GAO's longstanding practice of not recommending that an agency reimburse a protester its costs for filing and pursuing a protest where the protester does not diligently pursue its claim for costs.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to add a new paragraph (f)(4) to require the agency to file a response to the request within 15 days after the request is filed. The prior version of paragraph (f) did not require the agency to respond to a request. This change is intended to allow the agency to either agree to the request, which eliminates the need for GAO to issue a decision, or to provide a specific basis for the agency's objection to the request, upon which the protester must comment. Revised paragraph (f)(4) also requires the protester to file comments on the agency's response within 10 days, and further provides that GAO will dismiss the request if the protester fails to file comments within 10 days. This change is intended to provide an adequate record for GAO to review in issuing its decision, and also reflects that GAO will not issue a decision where the protester effectively abandons its request by failing to comment on the agency's response.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to add a new paragraph (f)(5) to reflect that GAO will recommend the amount of costs the agency should pay, and that GAO may also recommend that the agency pay the protester the costs of pursuing a claim for costs before GAO.</P>
        <P>GAO proposes to redesignate former paragraph (f)(3) as paragraph (f)(6). Redesignated paragraph (f)(6) is revised to require the agency to file within 60 days a notification of the action the agency took in response to the recommendation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Time for Decision by GAO</HD>
        <P>GAO proposes to revise paragraph (a) of 4 CFR 21.9 to reflect that a bid protest will be resolved within 100 days after it is filed, but that other decisions are not subject to the 100-day deadline. Revised paragraph (a) provides that GAO will attempt to resolve a request for recommendation for reimbursement of protest costs under 4 CFR 21.8(e), a request for recommendation on the amount of protest costs under 4 CFR 21.8(f), or a request for reconsideration under 4 CFR 21.14 within 100 days after the request is filed.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Notice of protest, communications among parties, submission of agency report, and time for filing of comments on report.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) GAO shall notify the agency within 1 day after the filing of a protest, and, unless the protest is dismissed under this part, shall promptly provide a written confirmation to the agency and an acknowledgment to the protester. The agency shall immediately give notice of the protest to the awardee if award has been made or, if no award has been made, to all bidders or offerors who appear to have a substantial prospect of receiving an award. The agency shall provide copies of the protest submissions to those parties, except where disclosure of the information is prohibited by law, with instructions to communicate further directly with GAO. All parties shall provide copies of all protest communications to the agency and to other participating parties either through EPDS or by email. GAO's Web site includes guidance regarding when to file through EPDS versus communicating by email or other means.</P>
          <STARS/>
          <P>(c) The agency shall file a report on the protest within 30 days after receiving notice of the protest from GAO. The report provided to the parties need not contain documents which the agency has previously provided or otherwise made available to the parties in response to the protest. At least 5 days prior to the filing of the report, in cases in which the protester has filed a request for specific documents, the agency shall file a response to the request for documents. If the fifth day prior to the filing of the report falls on a weekend or Federal holiday, the response shall be filed on the last business day that precedes the weekend or holiday. The agency's response shall, at a minimum, identify whether the requested documents exist, which of the requested documents or portions thereof the agency intends to produce, which of the requested documents or portions thereof the agency intends to withhold, and the basis for not producing any of the requested documents or portions thereof. Any objection to the scope of the agency's proposed disclosure or nondisclosure of documents must be filed within 2 days of receipt of this response.</P>
          <P>(d) The report shall include the contracting officer's statement of the relevant facts, including a best estimate of the contract value, a memorandum of law, and a list and a copy of all relevant documents, or portions of documents, not previously produced, including, as appropriate: the bid or proposal submitted by the protester; the bid or proposal of the firm which is being considered for award, or whose bid or proposal is being protested; all evaluation documents; the solicitation, including the specifications; the abstract of bids or offers; and any other relevant documents. In appropriate cases, a party may file a request that another party produce relevant documents, or portions of documents, that are not in the agency's possession.</P>
          <P>(e) Where a protester or intervenor does not have counsel admitted to a protective order and documents are withheld from the protester or intervenor on that basis, the agency shall file redacted documents that adequately inform the protester and/or intervenor of the basis of the agency's arguments in response to the protest. GAO's Web site provides guidance regarding filing documents where no protective order is issued or where a protester or intervenor does not have counsel admitted to a protective order.</P>
          <P>(f) The agency may file a request for an extension of time for the submission of the response to be provided by the agency pursuant to § 21.3(c) or for the submission of the agency report. * * *</P>
          <P>(g) The protester may file a request for additional documents after receipt of the agency report when their existence or relevance first becomes evident. Except when authorized by GAO, any request for additional documents must be filed not later than 2 days after their existence or relevance is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier. The agency shall file the requested documents, or portions of documents, within 2 days or explain why it is not required to produce the documents.</P>
          <P>(h) Upon a request filed by a party, GAO will decide whether the agency must provide any withheld documents, or portions of documents, and whether this should be done under a protective order. * * *</P>
          <P>(i)(1) Comments on the agency report shall be filed within 10 days after the agency has filed the report, except where GAO has granted an extension of time, or where GAO has established a shorter period for filing of comments. Extensions will be granted on a case-by-case basis.</P>
          <P>(2) The protest shall be dismissed unless the protester files comments within the period of time established in § 21.3(i)(1).</P>
          <P>(3) GAO will dismiss any protest allegation or argument where the agency's report responds to the allegation or argument, but the protester's comments fail to address that response.</P>

          <P>(b) Any agency or party filing a document that the agency or party believes to contain protected material shall provide to the other parties (unless they are not admitted to the protective order) an initial proposed redacted version of the document within 1 day after the protected version is filed. Where appropriate, the exhibits to the agency report or other documents may be proposed for redaction in their entirety. Within 5 days after the proposed redacted version of a document is provided, the party that authored the document shall file a final <PRTPAGE P="22202"/>redacted version of the document, which has been agreed to by all of the parties. Only the final agreed-to version of a redacted document must be filed. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement regarding redactions, the objecting party may submit the matter to GAO for resolution. Until GAO resolves the matter, the disputed information must be treated as protected.</P>
          <P>(c) If no protective order has been issued, or a protester or intervenor does not have counsel admitted to a protective order, the agency may withhold from the parties those portions of its report that would ordinarily be subject to a protective order, provided that the requirements of § 21.3(e) are met. * * *</P>
          <P>(d) After a protective order has been issued, counsel or consultants retained by counsel appearing on behalf of a party may apply for admission under the order by filing an application. * * * Objections to an applicant's admission shall be filed within 2 days after the application is filed, although GAO may consider objections filed after that time.</P>

        <P>On February 4, 2016, we published a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (81 FR 5969) announcing our intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee prior to publishing proposed regulations to implement part A of title I of the ESEA, as amended by the ESSA. We explained that the negotiated rulemaking committee would be convened to address proposed regulations that would: (1) Update existing assessment regulations to reflect changes to section 1111(b)(2) of the ESEA; and (2) relate to the requirement under section 1118(b) of the ESEA that title I, part A funds be used to supplement, and not supplant, non-Federal funds. In the February 4, 2016, notice, we set a schedule for three sessions of committee meetings, including an optional third session from April 18-April 19, 2016, if the committee determined that a third session would enable the committee to complete its work of developing regulations that reflect a final consensus of the committee. We also announced the date, time, and locations of the three sessions.</P>
        <P>We now announce that the April 18, 2016, meeting of the committee will be held at a different location than indicated in the February 4, 2016, notice.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Schedule for Negotiations:</E> The committee will meet for its third session on April 18-April 19, 2016. The committee meetings will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day.</P>
        <P>The April 18, 2016, committee meeting will be held at the U.S. Department of Education, Potomac Center Plaza, 550 12th Street SW., Washington, DC 22202. The April 19, 2016, committee meeting will be held at the U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20202.</P>

        <P>On September 11, 2014, the submittal for EKAPCD Rule 410.4A was found to meet the completeness criteria in 40 CFR part 51 Appendix V, which must be met before formal EPA review.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Are there other versions of this rule?</HD>
        <P>We approved an earlier version of Rule 410.4A into the SIP on November 13, 1998 (63 FR 63410). The EKAPCD adopted revisions to the SIP-approved version on March 13, 2014 and CARB submitted them to us on July 25, 2014.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. What is the purpose of the submitted rule revision?</HD>
        <P>VOCs help produce ground-level ozone, smog and particulate matter (PM), which harm human health and the environment. Section 110(a) of the CAA requires States to submit regulations that control VOC emissions. The purpose of this rule is to limit VOC emissions from coatings and solvents used in production, repair, refinish, or maintenance operations where motor vehicles, mobile equipment, or associated parts and components are coated.</P>
        <P>The EPA's technical support document (TSD) has more information about this rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. The EPA's Evaluation and Action</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. How is the EPA evaluating the rule?</HD>
        <P>SIP rules must be enforceable (see CAA section 110(a)(2)), must not interfere with applicable requirements concerning attainment and reasonable further progress or other CAA requirements (see CAA section 110(l)), and must not modify certain SIP control requirements in nonattainment areas without ensuring equivalent or greater emissions reductions (see CAA section 193).</P>

        <P>Generally, SIP rules must require Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) for each category of sources covered by a Control Techniques Guidelines (CTG) document as well as each major source of VOCs in ozone nonattainment areas classified as moderate or above (see CAA section 182(b)(2)). The EKAPCD regulates an ozone nonattainment area classified as Marginal Nonattainment for the 8-hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (40 CFR 81.305). In addition, EKAPCD is classified as Moderate for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS (40 CFR 81.305). There is no EPA CTG for Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Refinishing Operations and, according to CARB's facility search engine, there are no facilities that emit VOC in the EKAPCD for this category for the most recent database year of 2013. Therefore, Rule 410.4A is not required to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) pursuant to CAA section 182(b)(2).<PRTPAGE P="22206"/>
        </P>
        <P>Guidance and policy documents that we use to evaluate enforceability, revision/relaxation and rule stringency requirements for the applicable criteria pollutants include the following:</P>

        </EXTRACT>
        
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Does the rule meet the evaluation criteria?</HD>
        <P>Rule 410.4A improves the SIP by establishing more stringent emission limits, and by clarifying labeling, test methods and recordkeeping provisions. The rule is largely consistent with CAA requirements and relevant guidance regarding enforceability, stringency and SIP revisions. Rule provisions that do not meet the evaluation criteria are summarized below and discussed further in the TSD.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. What are the rule deficiencies?</HD>
        <P>These provisions do not satisfy the requirements of section 110 and part D of title I of the Act and prevent full approval of the SIP revision.</P>
        <P>• Paragraph VI(A), “VOC Content Limits,” provides VOC limits for cavity wax, deadener, gasket/gasket sealing material, lubricating wax/compounds and trunk interior coatings. However, in conflict with long-standing guidance on enforceability such as discussed in the Bluebook, these terms are not defined in the rule.<SU>1</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. EPA Recommendations To Further Improve the Rule</HD>
        <P>The TSD describes additional rule revisions that we recommend for the next time the local agency modifies the rule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Proposed Action and Public Comment</HD>
        <P>As authorized in sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Act, the EPA is proposing a limited approval of the submitted rule. If finalized, this action would incorporate the submitted rule into the SIP, including those provisions identified as deficient. This approval is limited because EPA is simultaneously proposing a limited disapproval of the rule under section 110(k)(3).</P>

        <P>Neither sanctions nor a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) would be imposed should the EPA finalize this limited disapproval. Sanctions would not be imposed under CAA 179(b) because the submittal of Rule 410.4A is discretionary (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> not required to be included in the SIP), and the EPA would not promulgate a FIP in this instance under CAA 110(c)(1) because the disapproval does not reveal a deficiency in the SIP for the area that a FIP must correct. Specifically, there is no EPA CTG for Motor Vehicle and Mobile Equipment Refinishing Operations and, according to CARB's Facility Search Engine, there are no facilities that emit VOC in the EKAPCD for this category for the most recent database year of 2013. Accordingly, the failure of the EKAPCD to adopt revisions to Rule 410.4A would not adversely affect the SIP's compliance with the CAA's requirements, such as the requirements for section 182 ozone RACT, reasonable further progress, and attainment demonstrations.</P>
        <P>Note that the submitted rule has been adopted by the EKAPCD, and the EPA's final limited disapproval would not prevent the local agency from enforcing it. The limited disapproval also would not prevent any portion of the rule from being incorporated by reference into the federally enforceable SIP.</P>
        <P>We will accept comments from the public on the proposed limited approval and limited disapproval for the next 30 days.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Incorporation by Reference</HD>

        <P>In this rule, the EPA is proposing to include in a final EPA rule regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is proposing to incorporate by reference EKAPCD Rule 410.4A as described in Table 1 of this notice. The EPA has made, and will continue to make, these documents available electronically through <E T="03">www.regulations.gov</E> and in hard copy at the appropriate EPA office (see the <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E> section of this preamble for more information).</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review and Executive Order 13563: Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review</HD>
        <P>This action is not a significant regulatory action and was therefore not submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)</HD>
        <P>This action does not impose an information collection burden under the PRA because this action does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)</HD>
        <P>I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the RFA. This action will not impose any requirements on small entities beyond those imposed by state law.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA)</HD>
        <P>This action does not contain any unfunded mandate as described in UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538, and does not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. This action does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. Accordingly, no additional costs to State, local, or tribal governments, or to the private sector, will result from this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Executive Order 13132: Federalism</HD>
        <P>This action does not have federalism implications. It will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Executive Order 13175: Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments</HD>

        <P>This action does not have tribal implications, as specified in Executive Order 13175, because the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction, and will not impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this action.<PRTPAGE P="22207"/>
        </P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks</HD>
        <P>The EPA interprets Executive Order 13045 as applying only to those regulatory actions that concern environmental health or safety risks that the EPA has reason to believe may disproportionately affect children, per the definition of “covered regulatory action” in section 2-202 of the Executive Order. This action is not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Executive Order 13211: Actions That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use</HD>
        <P>This action is not subject to Executive Order 13211, because it is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA)</HD>
        <P>Section 12(d) of the NTTAA directs the EPA to use voluntary consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. The EPA believes that this action is not subject to the requirements of section 12(d) of the NTTAA because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">J. Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Population</HD>

        <P/>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background and Purpose</HD>
        <P>In January 2003, the National Veterinary Medical Service Act (NVMSA) was passed into law adding section 1415A to the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1997 (NARETPA). This law established a new Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (7 U.S.C. 3151a) authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out a program of entering into agreements with veterinarians under which they agree to provide veterinary services in veterinarian shortage situations.</P>
        <P>Section 7105 of FCEA amended section 1415A to revise the determination of veterinarian shortage situations to consider (1) geographical areas that the Secretary determines have a shortage of veterinarians; and (2) areas of veterinary practice that the Secretary determines have a shortage of veterinarians, such as food animal medicine, public health, epidemiology, and food safety. This section also added that priority should be given to agreements with veterinarians for the practice of food animal medicine in veterinarian shortage situations.</P>

        <P>NARETPA section 1415A requires the Secretary, when determining the amount of repayment for a year of service by a veterinarian to consider the ability of USDA to maximize the number of agreements from the amounts appropriated and to provide an incentive to serve in veterinary service shortage areas with the greatest need. This section also provides that loan repayments may consist of payments of the principal and interest on government and commercial loans received by the individual for the attendance of the individual at an accredited college of veterinary medicine resulting in a degree of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine or the equivalent. This program is not authorized to provide repayments for any government or commercial loans incurred during the pursuit of another degree, such as an associate or bachelor degree. Loans eligible for repayment include educational loans made for one or more of the following: Loans for tuition expenses; other reasonable educational expenses, including fees, books, and laboratory expenses, incurred by the individual; and reasonable living expenses as determined by the Secretary. In addition, the Secretary is directed to make such additional payments to participants as the Secretary determines appropriate for the purpose of providing reimbursements to participants for individual tax liability resulting from participation in this program. Finally, this section requires USDA to promulgate regulations within 270 days of the enactment of FCEA (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> June 18, 2008). The Secretary delegated the authority to carry out this program to NIFA. The final rule was published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on April 19, 2010 [75 FR 20239-20248] allowing eligible veterinarians to competitively apply for and receive a VMLRP award.</P>

        <P>From FY 2010 through FY 2015, NIFA received 996 applications from which 340 VMLRP awards were offered. Additional information by funding year can be found at <E T="03">http://nifa.usda.gov/vmlrp-reports-and-statistics.</E> On December 18, 2015, the President signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), which appropriated $5,000,000 for the VMLRP. Funding for future years will be based on annual appropriations and balances, if any, remaining from prior years.</P>

        <P>The eligibility criteria for applicants and the application forms and associated instructions needed to apply for a VMLRP award can be viewed and downloaded from the VMLRP Web site at: <E T="03">http://nifa.usda.gov/vmlrp-applicants.</E>

        <P>The City of Waterville, Maine, grantee of FTZ 186, submitted a notification of proposed production activity to the FTZ Board on behalf of Flemish Master Weavers (FMW), located in Sanford, Maine. The notification conforming to the requirements of the regulations of the FTZ Board (15 CFR 400.22) was received on March 31, 2016.</P>
        <P>The FMW facility is located at 96 Gatehouse Road, Sanford, Maine. A separate application for subzone designation at the FMW facility has been submitted and will be processed under Section 400.25 of the FTZ Board's regulations. The facility is used for the production of area rugs using polypropylene and polyester yarns. Pursuant to 15 CFR 400.14(b) of the regulations, FTZ activity would be limited to the specific foreign-status materials and components and specific finished products described in the submitted notification (as described below) and subsequently authorized by the FTZ Board.</P>
        <P>Production under FTZ procedures could exempt FMW from customs duty payments on foreign status materials used in export production. On its domestic sales, FMW would be able to choose the duty rate during customs entry procedures that applies to area rugs (free) for the polypropylene and polyester yarns (duty rates: 8.0% and 8.8%, respectively) sourced from abroad. Customs duties also could possibly be deferred or reduced on foreign status production equipment.</P>
        <P>Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions shall be addressed to the FTZ Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is May 25, 2016.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Foreign-Trade Zone 172—Oneida County, New York; Application for Reorganization and Expansion Under Alternative Site Framework</SUBJECT>
        <P>An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones (FTZ) Board by the County of Oneida, grantee of FTZ 172, requesting authority to reorganize and expand the zone under the alternative site framework (ASF) adopted by the FTZ Board (15 CFR 400.2(c)). The ASF is an option for grantees for the establishment or reorganization of zones and can permit significantly greater flexibility in the designation of new subzones or “usage-driven” FTZ sites for operators/users located within a grantee's “service area” in the context of the FTZ Board's standard 2,000-acre activation limit for a zone. The application was submitted pursuant to the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally docketed on April 12, 2016.</P>

        <P>FTZ 172 was approved by the FTZ Board on January 8, 1991 (Board Order 502, 56 FR 1791; January 17, 1991). The <PRTPAGE P="22211"/>current zone includes the following sites: <E T="03">Site 1</E> (534 acres)—Oneida County Airport Industrial Park, Oneida County Airport, Oriskany; <E T="03">Site 2</E> (412 acres)—West Rome Industrial Park, 1 Success Dr, Rome; <E T="03">Site 2a</E> (100 acres)—Griffiss Business &amp; Technology Park Hanger Road, Rome; <E T="03">Site 3</E> (100 acres)—Boonville Industrial Park, Industrial Road, Boonville; <E T="03">Site 4</E> (82 acres)—Utica Business Park, Business Park Drive, Utica; and, <E T="03">Site 5</E> (52 acres)—East Arterial Industrial Park, Dwyer Avenue, Utica. The zone also includes Subzone 172A (Oneida Ltd.) with three sites in Sherrill and Oneida, New York.</P>
        <P>The grantee's proposed service area under the ASF would be Oneida County, New York, as described in the application. If approved, the grantee would be able to serve sites throughout the service area based on companies' needs for FTZ designation. The application indicates that the proposed service area is within and adjacent to the Syracuse, New York Customs and Border Protection port of entry.</P>

        <P>The applicant is requesting authority to renumber existing Site 2a as Site 6 and to include the renumbered Site 6 as a “magnet” site, as well as to remove Sites 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Subzone 172A. The ASF allows for the possible exemption of one magnet site from the “sunset” time limits that generally apply to sites under the ASF, and the applicant proposes that Site 6 be so exempted. The applicant is also requesting approval of the following magnet site: <E T="03">Proposed Site 7</E> (316.5 acres)—Marcy Nanocenter at SUNYIT, 5737 Marcy-SUNYIT Parkway, Marcy, Oneida County.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the FTZ Board's regulations, Elizabeth Whiteman of the FTZ Staff is designated examiner to evaluate and analyze the facts and information presented in the application and case record and to report findings and recommendations to the FTZ Board.</P>
        <P>Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions shall be addressed to the FTZ Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is June 14, 2016. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period to June 29, 2016.</P>

        <P>A copy of the application will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Executive Secretary, Foreign-Trade Zones Board, Room 21013, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1401 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230-0002, and in the “Reading Room” section of the FTZ Board's Web site, which is accessible via <E T="03">www.trade.gov/ftz</E>.

        <P>In accordance with our practice, we requested information from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) concerning imports of subject merchandise from these companies during the POR. We received the requested CBP information, which showed that neither ZFP nor NFP had suspended entries of subject merchandise during the POR. On October 6, 2015, we documented this finding and invited comments from interested parties regarding this CBP query result.<SU>4</SU>

        <P>On October 19, 2015, we received comments from domestic interested parties, Eramet and Felman Production, LLC (collectively, U.S. producers). On October 20, 2015, we received comments from ZFP and NFP (Ukrainian producers).

        <P>Because there is no evidence that there were entries of subject merchandise into the United States from Ukraine during the POR, on November 17, 2015, the Department placed a memorandum on the record notifying interested parties of its intent to rescind the 2014-2015 administrative review of silicomanganese from Ukraine, and invited comments.<SU>5</SU>

          <FTREF/> In its November 17, 2015, memorandum, the Department rejected the Ukrainian producers' arguments that the Department provided defective or inadequate notice concerning the correct anniversary month of the antidumping duty order on silicomanganese from Ukraine, and found no basis to alter the POR to capture the Ukrainian producers' entries <PRTPAGE P="22212"/>of subject merchandise made after the POR.<SU>6</SU>

The Department intends to issue assessment instructions to CBP 15 days after the publication date of the final results of this review. Additionally, pursuant to a refinement to its assessment practice in NME cases, if the Department continues to determine that an exporter under review had no shipments of the subject merchandise, any suspended entries that entered under the exporter's case number (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> at that exporter's rate) will be liquidated at the PRC-wide rate.

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until further notice.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notification to Importers</HD>
          <P>This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a certification regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries of this period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.</P>

        <P>The U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board (Board) is established pursuant to Department of Commerce authority under 15 U.S.C. 1512 and under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App. (FACA), and advises the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) on matters relating to the U.S. travel and tourism industry. The Board provides a means of ensuring regular contact between the U.S. Government and the travel and tourism industry. The Board advises the Secretary on government policies and programs that affect United States travel and tourism, and the Board serves as a forum for discussing and proposing solutions to industry-related problems. The Board acts as a liaison among the stakeholders represented by the membership and provides a forum for those stakeholders on current and emerging issues in the travel and <PRTPAGE P="22214"/>tourism sector. The Board recommends ways to ensure that the United States remains the preeminent destination for international visitation and tourism throughout the world.</P>
        <P>The Office of Advisory Committees and Industry Outreach is accepting applications for Board members. The Board shall consist of no more than 32 members appointed by the Secretary. Members shall represent companies and organizations in the travel and tourism sector from a broad range of products and services, company sizes, and geographic locations and shall be drawn from large, medium, and small travel and tourism companies, private-sector organizations involved in the export of travel and tourism-related products and services, and other tourism-related entities.</P>
        <P>Each Board member shall serve as the representative of a U.S. company in the travel and tourism industry, a private sector U.S. organization involved in the export of travel and tourism-related products and services, or a tourism-related U.S. entity. For eligibility purposes, a “U.S. company” is a for-profit firm that is incorporated in the United States (or an unincorporated U.S. firm with its principal place of business in the United States) that is controlled by U.S. citizens or by other U.S. companies. A company is not a U.S. company if 50 percent plus one share of its stock (if a corporation, or a similar ownership interest of an unincorporated entity) is known to be controlled, directly or indirectly, by non-U.S. citizens or non-U.S. companies. For eligibility purposes, a “U.S. organization” is an organization, including trade associations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), established under the laws of the United States, that is controlled by U.S. citizens, by another U.S. organization (or organizations), or by a U.S. company (or companies), as determined based on its board of directors (or comparable governing body), membership, and funding sources, as applicable. For eligibility purposes, a U.S. entity is a tourism-related entity that can demonstrate U.S. ownership or control, including but not limited to state and local tourism marketing entities, state government tourism offices, state and/or local government-supported tourism marketing entities, and multi-state tourism marketing entities.</P>
        <P>Members of the Board will be selected, in accordance with applicable Department of Commerce guidelines, based on their ability to carry out the objectives of the Board as set forth in the charter. Members of the Board shall be selected in a manner that ensures that the Board is balanced in terms of points of view, industry subsector, range of products and services, demographics, geography, and company size.</P>
        <P>Additional factors which will be considered in the selection of Board members include candidates' proven experience in the strategic development and management of travel and tourism-related or other service-related organizations; or the candidate's proven experience in promoting, developing, and implementing advertising and marketing programs for travel-related or tourism-related industries.</P>
        <P>Priority may be given to a Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director, or President (or comparable level of responsibility) of a U.S. company, U.S. organization, or U.S. entity in the travel and tourism sector.</P>
        <P>Members shall serve a term of two years from the date of appointment, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce. Although the Board's current charter terminates in September 2017, it is anticipated that it will be rechartered.</P>
        <P>Members shall serve in a representative capacity, representing the views and interests of their particular industry subsector. Board members are not special government employees, and will receive no compensation for their participation in Board activities. Members participating in Board meetings and events will be responsible for their travel, living and other personal expenses. Meetings will be held regularly and, to the extent practical, not less than twice annually, usually in Washington, DC.</P>

        <P>The recreational fishery for Atlantic migratory group cobia is scheduled to close on June 20, 2016. The closure applies to those fishing for cobia recreationally in federal waters from Georgia to New York from a private vessel, charter vessel, or headboat. The closure is the result of accountability measures required by federal regulations to protect the cobia resource and prevent overfishing. The 2015 recreational catch was 1,540,775 pounds, 123% over the recreational Annual Catch Limit (ACL) of 690,000 pounds.</P>
        <P>The scheduled recreational closure has caused concerns from fishermen, particularly those from North Carolina and Virginia where the closure will have negative economic and social impacts due to the seasonality of the fishery. As a result, the two Councils will host a Cobia Q&amp;A public meeting to provide information and help address questions and concerns. Council staff will give a presentation that includes an overview of the Council federal management process, historical management of cobia, and information about current cobia management and the pending recreational closure. The presentation will also include an overview of future management actions for cobia currently under consideration by the South Atlantic Council. Council staff and area Council members will be available to answer questions following the presentation.</P>

        <P>Written comments should be directed to Gregg Waugh, Executive Director, South Atlantic Fishery Management Council, 4055 Faber Place Drive, Suite 201, N. Charleston, SC 29405. Email comments to <E T="03">Mike.Collins@safmc.net</E> with the Subject Line “Cobia Comments”. FAX comments to (843) 769-4520.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Sections 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) direct the Secretary of Commerce to allow, upon request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical region if certain findings are made and either regulations are issued or, if the taking is limited to harassment, a notice of a proposed authorization is provided to the public for review.</P>
        <P>An authorization for incidental takings shall be granted if NMFS finds that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s), will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses (where relevant), and if the permissible methods of taking and requirements pertaining to the mitigation, monitoring and reporting of such takings are set forth. NMFS has defined “negligible impact” in 50 CFR 216.103 as “an impact resulting from the specified activity that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival.”</P>
        <P>Except with respect to certain activities not pertinent here, the MMPA defines “harassment” as: Any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which (i) has the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild [Level A harassment]; or (ii) has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering [Level B harassment].</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Summary of Request</HD>

        <P>On March 11, 2016, NMFS received an application from DWBI for the taking of marine mammals incidental to the installation of the BIWF export and inter-array cables. This work was originally authorized by NMFS as part of a September 2014 (modified in June 2015) IHA issued to DWBI for construction of the BIWF (offshore installation of wind turbine generator [WTG] jacket foundations and export/inter-array cable installation [79 FR 53409]); however, only the construction activities associated with the WTG jacket foundation installation were performed during that one-year authorization which expired in October 2015. DWBI has, therefore, reapplied for a new IHA to complete the remaining export and inter-array cable installation activities. The proposed export and inter-array cable installation activities <PRTPAGE P="22217"/>remain the same as those described in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice for the original 2014 BIWF IHA. NMFS determined that the application was adequate and complete on March 14, 2016.</P>
        <P>DWBI has begun construction of the BIWF, a 30 megawatt offshore wind farm. Construction activities began in July of 2015 with the installation of the five WTG foundations. The submarine cable (export and inter-array cables) installation is scheduled to occur sometime between May and October, 2016. Use of dynamically positioned (DP) vessel thrusters during cable installation may result in the take of marine mammals. Take, by Level B Harassment only, of individuals of nine species is anticipated to result from the specified activity.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Description of the Specified Activity</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Overview</HD>
        <P>The BIWF will consist of five, 6 megawatt WTGs, a submarine cable interconnecting the WTGs, and a transmission cable. The WTG jacket foundations were installed in 2015. Erection of the five WTGs, installation of the inter-array and export cable, and construction of the onshore components of the BIWF is planned for 2016. The generation of underwater noise during use of vessel thrusters while the cable laying vessel is keeping position by its DP system during installation activities may result in the incidental take of marine mammals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Dates and Duration</HD>
        <P>BIWF cable installation activities are scheduled to occur sometime between May and October, 2016. NMFS is proposing to issue an authorization effective May 2016 through April 2017, based on the anticipated work window for the in-water cable installation activities construction that could result in the incidental take of marine mammals. While project activities may occur for over a 6-month period, use of the DP vessel thruster during cable installation activities is expected to occur for approximately 28 days. Cable installation (and subsequent use of the DP vessel thruster) would be conducted 24 hours per day.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Specified Geographic Region</HD>
        <P>The offshore components of the BIWF will be located in state territorial waters. The WTGs will be located on average of about 4.8 kilometers (km) southeast of Block Island, and about 25.7 km south of the Rhode Island mainland. The WTGs will be arranged in a radial configuration spaced about 0.8 km apart. The inter-array cable will connect the five WTGs for a total length of 3.2 km from the northernmost WTG to the southernmost WTG (Figure 1-1 of DWBI's application). Water depths along the inter-array cable range up to 23.3 meters (m). The export cable will originate at the northernmost WTG and travel 10 km to a manhole located in the town of New Shoreham (Block Island) in Washington County, Rhode Island. Water depths along the export cable submarine route range up to 36.9 m. Construction staging and laydown for offshore construction is planned to occur at the Port of Providence, Providence, Rhode Island.</P>
        <P>The inter-array cable and submarine portions of the export cable will be installed by a jet plow supported by a DP vessel.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Detailed Description of Activities</HD>
        <P>DWBI would use a jet plow, supported by a DP cable installation barge, to install the export cable and inter-array cable below the seabed. The jet plow would be positioned over the trench and pulled from shore by the cable installation vessel. The jet plow would be pulled along the seafloor behind the cable-laying barge with assistance of a non-DP material barge. High-pressure water from vessel- mounted pumps would be injected into the sediments through nozzles situated along the plow, causing the sediments to temporarily fluidize and create a liquefied trench. DWBI anticipates a temporary trench width of up to 1.5 m. As the plow is pulled along the route behind the barge, the cable would be laid into the temporary, liquefied trench through the back of the plow. The trench would be backfilled by the water current and the natural settlement of the suspended material. Umbilical cords would connect the submerged jet plow to control equipment on the vessel to allow the operators to monitor and control the installation process and make adjustments to the speed and alignment as the installation proceeds across the water.</P>
        <P>The Export Cable and Inter-Array Cable would be buried to a target depth of 1.8 m beneath the seafloor. The actual burial depth depends on substrate encountered along the route and could vary from 1.2 to 2.4 m. If less than 1.2 m burial is achieved, DWBI may elect to install additional protection, such as concrete matting or rock piles. At each of the WTGs, the Inter-Array cable would be pulled into the jacket foundation through J-tubes installed on the sides of the jacket foundations. At the J-tubes, additional cable armoring such as sand bags and/or rocks would be used to protect the inter-array cable.</P>
        <P>A DP vessel would be used during cable installation in order to maintain precise coordinates. DP systems maintain their precise coordinates in waters through the use of automatic controls. These control systems use variable levels of power to counter forces from current and wind. During cable-lay activities, DWBI expects that a reduced 50 percent power level will be used by DP vessels. DWBI modeled scenarios using a source level of 180 dB re 1 micro Pascal (μPa) for the DP vessel thruster, assuming water depths of 7, 10, 20, and 40 m, and thruster power of 50 percent. Detailed information on the acoustic modeling for this source is provided in Appendix A of DWBI's application. Installation of the export cable and inter-array cable is expected to take approximately 28 days. Cable installation will occur 24 hours per day, seven days a week.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Description of Marine Mammals in the Area of the Specified Activity</HD>
        <P>There are 38 species of marine mammals protected under the MMPA that potentially occur within the marine waters around Rhode Island Sound (see Table 3-1 of DWBI's application). The majority of these species are pelagic and/or northern species, or are so rarely sighted that their presence in the project area is unlikely. Six marine mammal species are listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and are known to be present, at least seasonally, in the waters of Southern New England: Blue whale, fin whale, humpback whale, right whale, sei whale, and sperm whale. These species are highly migratory and do not spend extended periods of time in a localized area; the waters of Southern New England are primarily used as a stopover point for these species during seasonal movements north or south between important feeding and breeding grounds. While fin, humpback, and right whales have the potential to occur within the project area, the sperm, blue, and sei whales are more pelagic and/or northern species, and their presence within the shallow waters of the project area is unlikely. Because the potential for sperm, blue, and sei whales to occur within the project area during the marine construction period is unlikely, these species will not be described further in this analysis.</P>

        <P>The following species are both common in the waters of Rhode Island Sound and have the highest likelihood of occurring, at least seasonally, in the project area: North Atlantic right whale (<E T="03">Eubalaena glacialis</E>), humpback whale <PRTPAGE P="22218"/>(<E T="03">Megaptera novaeangliae</E>), fin whale (<E T="03">Balaenoptera physalus</E>), minke whale (<E T="03">Balaenoptera acutorostrata</E>), harbor porpoise (<E T="03">Phocoena phocoena</E>), Atlantic white-sided dolphin (<E T="03">Lagenorhynchus acutus</E>), short-beaked common dolphin (<E T="03">Delphinus delphis</E>), harbor seal (<E T="03">Phoca vitulina</E>), and gray seal (<E T="03">Halichorus grypus</E>) (Right Whale Consortium, 2014) (Table 1).</P>

        <P>Further information on the biology, ecology, abundance, and distribution of those species likely to occur in the project area can be found in section 4 of the application (which NMFS has reviewed and concluded as adequate), and the NMFS Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports (see Waring <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2015), which are available online at: <E T="03">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/sars/.</E> Marine mammal species descriptions are also available online at: <E T="03">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/mammals/.</E>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Potential Effects of the Specified Activity on Marine Mammals</HD>
        <P>This section includes a summary and discussion of the ways that the types of stressors associated with the specified activity have been observed to impact marine mammals. This discussion may also include reactions that we consider to rise to the level of a take and those that we do not consider to rise to the level of a take (for example, with acoustics, we may include a discussion of studies that showed animals not reacting at all to sound or exhibiting barely measurable avoidance). This section is intended as a background of potential effects and does not consider either the specific manner in which this activity will be carried out or the mitigation that will be implemented, and how either of those will shape the anticipated impacts from this specific activity. The “Estimated Take by Incidental Harassment” section later in this document will include a quantitative analysis of the number of individuals that are expected to be taken by this activity. The “Negligible Impact Analysis” section will include the analysis of how this specific activity will impact marine mammals and will consider the content of this “Potential Effects of the Specified Activity on Marine Mammals” section, the “Estimated Take by Incidental Harassment” section, the “Proposed Mitigation” section, and the “Anticipated Effects on Marine Mammal Habitat” section to draw conclusions regarding the likely impacts of this activity on the reproductive success or survivorship of individuals, and from that on the affected marine mammal populations or stocks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Background on Sound</HD>
        <P>Sound is a physical phenomenon consisting of minute vibrations that travel through a medium, such as air or water, and is generally characterized by several variables. Frequency describes the sound's pitch and is measured in hertz (Hz) or kilohertz (kHz), while sound level describes the sound's intensity and is measured in decibels (dB). Sound level increases or decreases exponentially with each dB of change. The logarithmic nature of the scale means that each 10-dB increase is a 10-fold increase in acoustic power (and a 20-dB increase is then a 100-fold increase in power). A 10-fold increase in acoustic power does not mean that the sound is perceived as being 10 times louder, however. Sound levels are compared to a reference sound pressure (micro-Pascal) to identify the medium. For air and water, these reference pressures are “re: 20 μPa” and “re: 1 μPa,” respectively. Root mean square (RMS) is the quadratic mean sound pressure over the duration of an impulse. RMS is calculated by squaring all of the sound amplitudes, averaging the squares, and then taking the square root of the average (Urick, 1975). RMS accounts for both positive and negative values; squaring the pressures makes all values positive so that they may be accounted for in the summation of pressure levels. This measurement is often used in the context of discussing behavioral effects, in part because behavioral effects, which often result from auditory cues, may be better expressed through averaged units rather than by peak pressures.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Acoustic Impacts</HD>

        <P>Use of the DP vessel thrusters during the BIWF project may temporarily impact marine mammals in the area due to elevated in-water sound levels. Marine mammals are continually exposed to many sources of sound. Naturally occurring sounds such as lightning, rain, sub-sea earthquakes, and biological sounds (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> snapping shrimp, whale songs) are widespread throughout the world's oceans. Marine mammals produce sounds in various contexts and use sound for various biological functions including, but not limited to: (1) Social interactions; (2) <PRTPAGE P="22219"/>foraging; (3) orientation; and (4) predator detection. Interference with producing or receiving these sounds may result in adverse impacts. Audible distance, or received levels of sound depend on the nature of the sound source, ambient noise conditions, and the sensitivity of the receptor to the sound (Richardson <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1995). Type and significance of marine mammal reactions to sound are likely dependent on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, (1) the behavioral state of the animal (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> feeding, traveling, etc.); (2) frequency of the sound; (3) distance between the animal and the source; and (4) the level of the sound relative to ambient conditions (Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007).</P>

        <P>When considering the influence of various kinds of sound on the marine environment, it is necessary to understand that different kinds of marine life are sensitive to different frequencies of sound. Current data indicate that not all marine mammal species have equal hearing capabilities (Richardson <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1995; Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1997; Wartzok and Ketten, 1999; Au and Hastings, 2008).</P>
        <P>Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007) designated “functional hearing groups” for marine mammals based on available behavioral data; audiograms derived from auditory evoked potentials; anatomical modeling; and other data. Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007) also estimated the lower and upper frequencies of functional hearing for each group. However, animals are less sensitive to sounds at the outer edges of their functional hearing range and are more sensitive to a range of frequencies within the middle of their functional hearing range. Note that direct measurements of hearing sensitivity do not exist for all species of marine mammals, including low-frequency cetaceans. The functional hearing groups and the associated frequencies developed by Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007) were revised by Finneran and Jenkins (2012) and have been further modified by NOAA. Table 2 provides a summary of sound production and general hearing capabilities for marine mammal species (note that values in this table are not meant to reflect absolute possible maximum ranges, rather they represent the best known ranges of each functional hearing group). For purposes of the analysis in this document, marine mammals are arranged into the following functional hearing groups based on their generalized hearing sensitivities: High-frequency cetaceans, mid-frequency cetaceans, low-frequency cetaceans (mysticetes), phocids (true seals), and otariids (sea lion and fur seals). A detailed discussion of the functional hearing groups can be found in Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007) and Finneran and Jenkins (2012).</P>

Functional hearing is defined as the range of frequencies a group hears without incorporating non-acoustic mechanisms (Wartzok and Ketten, 1999). This is ~60 to ~70 dB above best hearing sensitivity (Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007) for all functional hearing groups except LF cetaceans, where no direct measurements on hearing are available.

        </GPOTABLE>

        <P>When sound travels (propagates) from its source, its loudness decreases as the distance traveled by the sound increases. Thus, the loudness of a sound at its source is higher than the loudness of that same sound a kilometer away. Acousticians often refer to the loudness of a sound at its source (typically referenced to one meter from the source) as the source level and the loudness of sound elsewhere as the received level (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> typically the receiver). For example, a humpback whale 3 km from a device that has a source level of 230 dB may only be exposed to sound that is 160 dB loud, depending on how the sound travels through water (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> spherical spreading [6 dB reduction with doubling of distance] was used in this example). As a result, it is important to understand the difference between source levels and received levels when discussing the loudness of sound in the ocean or its impacts on the marine environment.</P>
        <P>As sound travels from a source, its propagation in water is influenced by various physical characteristics, including water temperature, depth, salinity, and surface and bottom properties that cause refraction, reflection, absorption, and scattering of sound waves. Oceans are not homogeneous and the contribution of each of these individual factors is extremely complex and interrelated. The physical characteristics that determine the sound's speed through the water will change with depth, season, geographic location, and with time of day (as a result, in actual active sonar operations, crews will measure oceanic conditions, such as sea water temperature and depth, to calibrate models that determine the path the sonar signal will take as it travels through the ocean and how strong the sound signal will be at a given range along a particular transmission path). As sound travels through the ocean, the intensity associated with the wavefront diminishes, or attenuates. This decrease in intensity is referred to as propagation loss, also commonly called transmission loss.</P>

        <P>As mentioned previously in this document, nine marine mammal species (seven cetaceans and two pinnipeds) are most likely to occur in the project area. Of the seven cetacean species likely to occur in the project area, four are classified as low-frequency cetaceans (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> minke whale, fin whale, humpback whale, and North Atlantic right whale), two are classified as mid-frequency cetaceans (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Atlantic white-sided dolphin and short-beaked common dolphin), and one is classified as a high-frequency cetacean (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> harbor porpoise) (Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007). A species' functional hearing group is a consideration when we analyze the effects of exposure to sound on marine mammals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Hearing Impairment</HD>

        <P>Marine mammals may experience temporary or permanent hearing impairment when exposed to loud sounds. Hearing impairment is <PRTPAGE P="22220"/>classified by temporary threshold shift (TTS) and permanent threshold shift (PTS). There are no empirical data for onset of PTS in any marine mammal; therefore, PTS-onset must be estimated from TTS-onset measurements and from the rate of TTS growth with increasing exposure levels above the level eliciting TTS-onset. PTS is presumed to be likely if the hearing threshold is reduced by ≥40 dB (that is, 40 dB of TTS). PTS is considered auditory injury (Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007) and occurs in a specific frequency range and amount. Irreparable damage to the inner or outer cochlear hair cells may cause PTS; however, other mechanisms are also involved, such as exceeding the elastic limits of certain tissues and membranes in the middle and inner ears and resultant changes in the chemical composition of the inner ear fluids (Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007). Given the higher level of sound and longer durations of exposure necessary to cause PTS as compared with TTS, it is considerably less likely that PTS would occur during DP vessel thruster use associated with the cable laying activities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Temporary Threshold Shift (TTS)</HD>

        <P>TTS is the mildest form of hearing impairment that can occur during exposure to a loud sound (Kryter, 1985). While experiencing TTS, the hearing threshold rises and a sound must be stronger in order to be heard. At least in terrestrial mammals, TTS can last from minutes or hours to (in cases of strong TTS) days, can be limited to a particular frequency range, and can occur to varying degrees (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a loss of a certain number of dBs of sensitivity). For sound exposures at or somewhat above the TTS threshold, hearing sensitivity in both terrestrial and marine mammals recovers rapidly after exposure to the noise ends.</P>

        <P>Marine mammal hearing plays a critical role in communication with conspecifics and in interpretation of environmental cues for purposes such as predator avoidance and prey capture. Depending on the degree (elevation of threshold in dB), duration (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> recovery time), and frequency range of TTS and the context in which it is experienced, TTS can have effects on marine mammals ranging from discountable to serious. For example, a marine mammal may be able to readily compensate for a brief, relatively small amount of TTS in a non-critical frequency range that takes place during a time when the animals is traveling through the open ocean, where ambient noise is lower and there are not as many competing sounds present. Alternatively, a larger amount and longer duration of TTS sustained during a time when communication is critical for successful mother/calf interactions could have more serious impacts if it were in the same frequency band as the necessary vocalizations and of a severity that it impeded communication. The fact that animals exposed to levels and durations of sound that would be expected to result in this physiological response would also be expected to have behavioral responses of a comparatively more severe or sustained nature is also notable and potentially of more importance than the simple existence of a TTS.</P>

        <P>Currently, TTS data only exist for four species of cetaceans (bottlenose dolphin, beluga whale [<E T="03">Delphinapterus leucas</E>], harbor porpoise, and Yangtze finless porpoise [<E T="03">Neophocoena asiaeorientalis</E>]) and three species of pinnipeds (northern elephant seal, harbor seal, and California sea lion) exposed to a limited number of sound sources (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> mostly tones and octave-band noise) in laboratory settings (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Finneran <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2002 and 2010; Nachtigall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2004; Kastak <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2005; Lucke <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2009; Mooney <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2009; Popov <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2011; Finneran and Schlundt, 2010). In general, harbor seals (Kastak <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2005; Kastelein <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2012a) and harbor porpoises (Lucke <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2009; Kastelein <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2012b) have a lower TTS onset than other measured pinniped or cetacean species. However, even for these animals, which are better able to hear higher frequencies and may be more sensitive to higher frequencies, exposures on the order of approximately 170 dB rms or higher for brief transient signals are likely required for even temporary (recoverable) changes in hearing sensitivity that would likely not be categorized as physiologically damaging (NEFSC, 2014). Additionally, the existing marine mammal TTS data come from a limited number of individuals within these species. There are no data available on noise-induced hearing loss for mysticetes. For summaries of data on TTS in marine mammals or for further discussion of TTS onset thresholds, please see Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007), Finneran and Jenkins (2012), and Finneran (2015).</P>

        <P>Scientific literature highlights the inherent complexity of predicting TTS onset in marine mammals, as well as the importance of considering exposure duration when assessing potential impacts (Mooney <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2009a, 2009b; Kastak <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007). Generally, with sound exposures of equal energy, quieter sounds (lower SPL) of longer duration were found to induce TTS onset more than louder sounds (higher SPL) of shorter duration. For intermittent sounds, less threshold shift will occur than from a continuous exposure with the same energy (some recovery will occur between intermittent exposures) (Kryter <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1966; Ward, 1997). For sound exposures at or somewhat above the TTS-onset threshold, hearing sensitivity recovers rapidly after exposure to the sound ends. Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007) considers a 6 dB TTS (that is, baseline thresholds are elevated by 6 dB) to be a sufficient definition of TTS-onset. NMFS considers TTS as Level B harassment that is mediated by physiological effects on the auditory system; however, NMFS does not consider TTS-onset to be the lowest level at which Level B harassment may occur.</P>
        <P>Although the duration of the DP thruster sound source has the potential to induce TTS onset, animals in the project during the inter-array and export cable installation activities are not expected to incur more than mild TTS hearing impairment due to low source levels and the fact that most marine mammals would more likely avoid a loud sound source rather than swim in such close proximity as to result in TTS. Any disturbance to marine mammals is likely to be in the form of temporary avoidance or alteration of opportunistic foraging behavior near the survey location.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Masking</HD>

        <P>Masking is the obscuring of sounds of interest to an animal by other sounds, typically at similar frequencies. Chronic exposure to excessive, though not high-intensity, noise has the potential to cause masking at particular frequencies for marine mammals that utilize sound for vital biological functions (Clark <E T="03">et al.</E> 2009). Marine mammals are highly dependent on sound, and their ability to recognize sound signals amid other sound is important in communication and detection of both predators and prey. Background ambient sound may interfere with or mask the ability of an animal to detect a sound signal even when that signal is above its absolute hearing threshold. Even in the absence of anthropogenic sound, the marine environment is often loud. Natural ambient sound includes contributions from wind, waves, precipitation, other animals, and (at frequencies above 30 kHz) thermal sound resulting from molecular agitation (Richardson <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1995).</P>

        <P>Background sound may also include anthropogenic sound, and masking of natural sounds can result when human activities produce high levels of background sound. Conversely, if the background level of underwater sound <PRTPAGE P="22221"/>is high (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> on a day with strong wind and high waves), an anthropogenic sound source would not be detectable as far away as would be possible under quieter conditions and would itself be masked. Ambient sound is highly variable on continental shelves (Thompson, 1965; Myrberg, 1978; Chapman <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1998; Desharnais <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1999). This results in a high degree of variability in the range at which marine mammals can detect anthropogenic sounds.</P>

        <P>Although masking is a phenomenon which may occur naturally, the introduction of loud anthropogenic sounds into the marine environment at frequencies important to marine mammals increases the severity and frequency of occurrence of masking. For example, if a baleen whale is exposed to continuous low-frequency sound from an industrial source, this would reduce the size of the area around that whale within which it can hear the calls of another whale. The components of background noise that are similar in frequency to the signal in question primarily determine the degree of masking of that signal. In general, little is known about the degree to which marine mammals rely upon detection of sounds from conspecifics, predators, prey, or other natural sources. In the absence of specific information about the importance of detecting these natural sounds, it is not possible to predict the impact of masking on marine mammals (Richardson <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1995). In general, masking effects are expected to be less severe when sounds are transient than when they are continuous. Masking is typically of greater concern for those marine mammals that utilize low-frequency communications, such as baleen whales, because of how far low-frequency sounds propagate. Therefore, since noise generated from vessels dynamic positioning activity is mostly concentrated at low frequency ranges, it may have less effect on high frequency echolocation sounds by odontocetes (toothed whales).</P>
        <P>As the DP vessel is continually moving along the cable route over a 24-hour period, the area within the 120 dB isopleth is constantly moving and shifting within a 24-hour period.</P>
        <P>Therefore, no single area in Rhode Island Sound will have noise levels above 120 dB for more than a few hours. While continuous sound from the DP thruster when in use is predicted to extend up to 4.75 km to the 120 dB threshold, the low source levels, coupled with the likelihood of animals to avoid the sound source, would result in very little opportunity for this activity to mask the communication of local marine mammals for more than a brief period of time.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Non-Auditory Physical Effects (Stress)</HD>

        <P>Classic stress responses begin when an animal's central nervous system perceives a potential threat to its homeostasis. That perception triggers stress responses regardless of whether a stimulus actually threatens the animal; the mere perception of a threat is sufficient to trigger a stress response (Moberg, 2000; Sapolsky <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2005; Seyle, 1950). Once an animal's central nervous system perceives a threat, it mounts a biological response or defense that consists of a combination of the four general biological defense responses: Behavioral responses, autonomic nervous system responses, neuroendocrine responses, or immune responses.</P>
        <P>In the case of many stressors, an animal's first and sometimes most economical (in terms of biotic costs) response is behavioral avoidance of the potential stressor or avoidance of continued exposure to a stressor. An animal's second line of defense to stressors involves the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system and the classical “fight or flight” response which includes the cardiovascular system, the gastrointestinal system, the exocrine glands, and the adrenal medulla to produce changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and gastrointestinal activity that humans commonly associate with “stress.” These responses have a relatively short duration and may or may not have significant long-term effect on an animal's welfare.</P>

        <P>An animal's third line of defense to stressors involves its neuroendocrine systems; the system that has received the most study has been the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal system (also known as the HPA axis in mammals or the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis in fish and some reptiles). Unlike stress responses associated with the autonomic nervous system, virtually all neuro-endocrine functions that are affected by stress—including immune competence, reproduction, metabolism, and behavior—are regulated by pituitary hormones. Stress-induced changes in the secretion of pituitary hormones have been implicated in failed reproduction (Moberg, 1987; Rivier, 1995), altered metabolism (Elasser <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2000), reduced immune competence (Blecha, 2000), and behavioral disturbance. Increases in the circulation of glucocorticosteroids (cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone in marine mammals; see Romano <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2004) have been equated with stress for many years.</P>
        <P>The primary distinction between stress (which is adaptive and does not normally place an animal at risk) and distress is the biotic cost of the response. During a stress response, an animal uses glycogen stores that can be quickly replenished once the stress is alleviated. In such circumstances, the cost of the stress response would not pose a risk to the animal's welfare. However, when an animal does not have sufficient energy reserves to satisfy the energetic costs of a stress response, energy resources must be diverted from other biotic function, which impairs those functions that experience the diversion. For example, when mounting a stress response diverts energy away from growth in young animals, those animals may experience stunted growth. When mounting a stress response diverts energy from a fetus, an animal's reproductive success and its fitness will suffer. In these cases, the animals will have entered a pre-pathological or pathological state which is called “distress” (Seyle, 1950) or “allostatic loading” (McEwen and Wingfield, 2003). This pathological state will last until the animal replenishes its biotic reserves sufficient to restore normal function. Note that these examples involved a long-term (days or weeks) stress response exposure to stimuli.</P>

        <P>Relationships between these physiological mechanisms, animal behavior, and the costs of stress responses have also been documented fairly well through controlled experiments; because this physiology exists in every vertebrate that has been studied, it is not surprising that stress responses and their costs have been documented in both laboratory and free-living animals (for examples see, Holberton <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1996; Hood <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1998; Jessop <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2003; Krausman <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2004; Lankford <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2005; Reneerkens <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2002; Thompson and Hamer, 2000). Information has also been collected on the physiological responses of marine mammals to exposure to anthropogenic sounds (Fair and Becker, 2000; Romano <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2002; Wright <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2008). For example, Rolland <E T="03">et al.</E> (2012) found that noise reduction from reduced ship traffic in the Bay of Fundy was associated with decreased stress in North Atlantic right whales. In a conceptual model developed by the Population Consequences of Acoustic Disturbance (PCAD) working group, serum hormones were identified as possible indicators of behavioral effects that are translated into altered rates of reproduction and mortality.<PRTPAGE P="22222"/>
        </P>

        <P>Studies of other marine animals and terrestrial animals would also lead us to expect some marine mammals to experience physiological stress responses and, perhaps, physiological responses that would be classified as “distress” upon exposure to high frequency, mid-frequency, or low-frequency sounds. For example, Jansen (1998) reported on the relationship between acoustic exposures and physiological responses that are indicative of stress responses in humans (for example, elevated respiration and increased heart rates). Jones (1998) reported on reductions in human performance when faced with acute, repetitive exposures to acoustic disturbance. Trimper <E T="03">et al.</E> (1998) reported on the physiological stress responses of osprey to low-level aircraft noise while Krausman <E T="03">et al.</E> (2004) reported on the auditory and physiology stress responses of endangered Sonoran pronghorn to military overflights. Smith <E T="03">et al.</E> (2004a, 2004b), for example, identified noise-induced physiological transient stress responses in hearing-specialist fish (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> goldfish) that accompanied short- and long-term hearing losses. Welch and Welch (1970) reported physiological and behavioral stress responses that accompanied damage to the inner ears of fish and several mammals.</P>
        <P>Hearing is one of the primary senses marine mammals use to gather information about their environment and to communicate with conspecifics. Although empirical information on the relationship between sensory impairment (TTS, PTS, and acoustic masking) on marine mammals remains limited, it seems reasonable to assume that reducing an animal's ability to gather information about its environment and to communicate with other members of its species would be stressful for animals that use hearing as their primary sensory mechanism. Therefore, we assume that acoustic exposures sufficient to trigger onset PTS or TTS would be accompanied by physiological stress responses because terrestrial animals exhibit those responses under similar conditions (NRC, 2003). More importantly, marine mammals might experience stress responses at received levels lower than those necessary to trigger onset TTS. Based on empirical studies of the time required to recover from stress responses (Moberg, 2000), we also assume that stress responses are likely to persist beyond the time interval required for animals to recover from TTS and might result in pathological and pre-pathological states that would be as significant as behavioral responses to TTS.</P>

        <P>In general, there are few data on the potential for strong, anthropogenic underwater sounds to cause non-auditory physical effects in marine mammals. Such effects, if they occur at all, would presumably be limited to short distances and to activities that extend over a prolonged period. The available data do not allow identification of a specific exposure level above which non-auditory effects can be expected (Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007). There is no definitive evidence that any of these effects occur even for marine mammals in close proximity to an anthropogenic sound source. In addition, marine mammals that show behavioral avoidance of vessels and related sound sources, are unlikely to incur non-auditory impairment or other physical effects. NMFS does not expect that the generally short-term and transitory cable installation activities would create conditions of long-term, continuous noise leading to long-term physiological stress responses in marine mammals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Behavioral Disturbance</HD>

        <P>Behavioral responses to sound are highly variable and context-specific. An animal's perception of and response to (in both nature and magnitude) an acoustic event can be influenced by prior experience, perceived proximity, bearing of the sound, familiarity of the sound, etc. (Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007). If a marine mammal does react briefly to an underwater sound by changing its behavior or moving a small distance, the impacts of the change are unlikely to be significant to the individual, let alone the stock or population. However, if a sound source displaces marine mammals from an important feeding or breeding area for a prolonged period, impacts on individuals and populations could be significant (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Lusseau and Bejder, 2007; Weilgart, 2007).</P>
        <P>Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007) reports the results of the efforts of a panel of experts in acoustic research from behavioral, physiological, and physical disciplines that convened and reviewed the available literature on marine mammal hearing and physiological and behavioral responses to human-made sound with the goal of proposing exposure criteria for certain effects. This peer-reviewed compilation of literature is very valuable, though Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007) note that not all data are equal, some have poor statistical power, insufficient controls, and/or limited information on received levels, background noise, and other potentially important contextual variables—such data were reviewed and sometimes used for qualitative illustration but were not included in the quantitative analysis for the criteria recommendations. All of the studies considered, however, contain an estimate of the received sound level when the animal exhibited the indicated response.</P>
        <P>In the Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007) publication, for the purposes of analyzing responses of marine mammals to anthropogenic sound and developing criteria, the authors differentiate between pulse sounds (single and multiple) and non-pulse sounds.</P>
        <P>The studies that address responses of low-frequency cetaceans to non-pulse sounds sounds (such as the sound emitted from a DP vessel thruster) include data gathered in the field and related to several types of sound sources, including: Vessel noise, drilling and machinery playback, low-frequency M-sequences (sine wave with multiple phase reversals) playback, tactical low-frequency active sonar playback, drill ships, and non-pulse playbacks. These studies generally indicate no (or very limited) responses to received levels in the 90 to 120 dB re: 1µPa range and an increasing likelihood of avoidance and other behavioral effects in the 120 to 160 dB range. As mentioned earlier, though, contextual variables play a very important role in the reported responses and the severity of effects do not increase linearly with received levels. Also, few of the laboratory or field datasets had common conditions, behavioral contexts, or sound sources, so it is not surprising that responses differ.</P>

        <P>The studies that address responses of mid-frequency cetaceans to non-pulse sounds include data gathered both in the field and the laboratory and related to several different sound sources, including: Pingers, drilling playbacks, ship and ice-breaking noise, vessel noise, Acoustic harassment devices (AHDs), Acoustic Deterrent Devices (ADDs), mid-frequency active sonar, and non-pulse bands and tones. Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007) were unable to come to a clear conclusion regarding the results of these studies. In some cases animals in the field showed significant responses to received levels between 90 and 120 dB, while in other cases these responses were not seen in the 120 to 150 dB range. The disparity in results was likely due to contextual variation and the differences between the results in the field and laboratory data (animals typically responded at lower levels in the field).</P>

        <P>The studies that address responses of high-frequency cetaceans to non-pulse sounds include data gathered both in <PRTPAGE P="22223"/>the field and the laboratory and related to several different sound sources, including: Pingers, AHDs, and various laboratory non-pulse sounds. All of these data were collected from harbor porpoises. Southall <E T="03">et al.</E> (2007) concluded that the existing data indicate that harbor porpoises are likely sensitive to a wide range of anthropogenic sounds at low received levels (around 90 to 120 dB), at least for initial exposures. All recorded exposures above 140 dB induced profound and sustained avoidance behavior in wild harbor porpoises (Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007). Rapid habituation was noted in some but not all studies.</P>

        <P>The studies that address the responses of pinnipeds in water to non-pulse sounds include data gathered both in the field and the laboratory and related to several different sound sources, including: AHDs, various non-pulse sounds used in underwater data communication, underwater drilling, and construction noise. Few studies exist with enough information to include them in the analysis. The limited data suggest that exposures to non-pulse sounds between 90 and 140 dB generally do not result in strong behavioral responses of pinnipeds in water, but no data exist at higher received levels (Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007).</P>
        <P>The low source level and relatively short duration of the DP vessel thrusters during cable installation activities would likely result in only brief startling reactions or short-term and temporary avoidance of the area, rather than permanent abandonment, by marine mammals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Tolerance</HD>

        <P>Numerous studies have shown that underwater sounds from industrial activities are often readily detectable by marine mammals in the water at distances of many kilometers. However, other studies have shown that marine mammals at distances more than a few kilometers away often show no apparent response to industrial activities of various types (Miller <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2005). This is often true even in cases when the sounds must be readily audible to the animals based on measured received levels and the hearing sensitivity of that mammal group. Although various baleen whales, toothed whales, and (less frequently) pinnipeds have been shown to react behaviorally to underwater sound from sources such as airgun pulses or vessels under some conditions, at other times, mammals of all three types have shown no overt reactions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Malme <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1986; Richardson <E T="03">et al.,</E> 1995; Madsen and Mohl, 2000; Croll <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2001; Jacobs and Terhune, 2002; Madsen <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2002; Miller <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2005). In general, pinnipeds seem to be more tolerant of exposure to some types of underwater sound than are baleen whales. Richardson <E T="03">et al.</E> (1995) found that vessel sound does not seem to strongly affect pinnipeds that are already in the water. Richardson <E T="03">et al.</E> (1995) went on to explain that seals on haul-outs sometimes respond strongly to the presence of vessels and at other times appear to show considerable tolerance of vessels, and Brueggeman <E T="03">et al.</E> (1992) observed ringed seals (<E T="03">Pusa hispida</E>) hauled out on ice pans displaying short-term escape reactions when a ship approached within 0.16-0.31 mi (0.25-0.5 km).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Vessel Strike</HD>

        <P>Ship strikes of marine mammals can cause major wounds, which may lead to the death of the animal. An animal at the surface could be struck directly by a vessel, a surfacing animal could hit the bottom of a vessel, or a vessel's propeller could injure an animal just below the surface. The severity of injuries typically depends on the size and speed of the vessel (Knowlton and Kraus, 2001; Laist <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2001; Vanderlaan and Taggart, 2007).</P>

        <P>The most vulnerable marine mammals are those that spend extended periods of time at the surface in order to restore oxygen levels within their tissues after deep dives (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the sperm whale). In addition, some baleen whales, such as the North Atlantic right whale, seem generally unresponsive to vessel sound, making them more susceptible to vessel collisions (Nowacek <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2004). These species are primarily large, slow moving whales. Smaller marine mammals (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> bottlenose dolphin) move quickly through the water column and are often seen riding the bow wave of large ships. Marine mammal responses to vessels may include avoidance and changes in dive pattern (NRC, 2003).</P>

        <P>An examination of all known ship strikes from all shipping sources (civilian and military) indicates vessel speed is a principal factor in whether a vessel strike results in death (Knowlton and Kraus, 2001; Laist <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2001; Jensen and Silber, 2003; Vanderlaan and Taggart, 2007). In assessing records with known vessel speeds, Laist <E T="03">et al.</E> (2001) found a direct relationship between the occurrence of a whale strike and the speed of the vessel involved in the collision. The authors concluded that most deaths occurred when a vessel was traveling in excess of 24.1 km/h (14.9 mph; 13 kts).</P>

        <P>Given the slow vessel speeds and predictable course necessary for jet-plowing and related cable installation activities for the BIWF project, ship strike is unlikely to occur. Marine mammals would be able to easily avoid vessels and are likely already habituated to the presence of numerous vessels in the area. Right whales have been observed in or near Rhode Island during all four seasons; however, they are most common in the spring when they are migrating and in the fall during their southbound migration (Kenney and Vigness-Raposa, 2009). Portions of the BIWF project area are located within the NMFS-designated Mid-Atlantic seasonal management area (SMA) (see 50 CFR 224.105); thus, to minimize the potential for vessel collision with right whales and other marine mammal species all DWBI vessels associated with the BIWF construction will operate at speeds of 10 knots or less from the November 1 to April 30 time period, regardless of whether they are inside or outside of the designated SMA. In addition, all DWBI vessels associated with the BIWF construction will adhere to NMFS guidelines for marine mammal ship striking avoidance (available online at: <E T="03">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/education/viewing_northeast.pdf</E>), including maintaining a distance of at least 1,500 feet from right whales and having dedicated protected species observers who will communicate with the captain to ensure that all measures to avoid whales are taken. NMFS believes that the size of right whales, their slow movements, and the amount of time they spend at the surface will make them extremely likely to be spotted by protected species observers during construction activities within the BIWF project area.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Anticipated Effects on Marine Mammal Habitat</HD>

        <P>There are no feeding areas, rookeries, or mating grounds known to be biologically important to marine mammals within the proposed project area. There is also no designated critical habitat for any ESA-listed marine mammals. Harbor seals haul out on Block Island and points along Narragansett Bay, the most important haul-out being on the edge of New Harbor, about 2.4 km from the proposed BIWF landfall on Block Island. The only consistent haul-out locations for gray seals within the vicinity of Rhode Island are around Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge and Nantucket Sound in Massachusetts (more than 80 nautical miles from the proposed project area). As discussed above, NMFS' regulations at 50 CFR 224 designated the nearshore <PRTPAGE P="22224"/>waters of the Mid-Atlantic Bight as the Mid-Atlantic U.S. SMA for right whales in 2008. Mandatory vessel speed restrictions are in place in that SMA from November 1 through April 30 to reduce the threat of collisions between ships and right whales around their migratory route and calving grounds.</P>
        <P>The BIWF involves activities that would disturb the seafloor and potentially affect benthic and finfish communities. Installation of the inter-array cable and export cable would result in the temporary disturbance of no more than 3.7 and 11.6 acres of seafloor, respectively. These installation activities would also result in temporary and localized increases in turbidity around the proposed project area. DWBI may also be required to install additional protective armoring in areas where the burial depth achieved is less than 1.2 m. DWBI expects that additional protection would be required at a maximum of 1 percent of the entire submarine cable, resulting in a conversion of up to 0.4 acres of soft substrate to hard substrate along the cable route. During the installation of additional protective armoring at the cable crossings and as necessary along the cable route, anchors and anchor chains would temporarily impact about 1.8 acres of bottom substrate during each anchoring event.</P>
        <P>Jet-plowing and impacts from construction vessel anchor placement and/or sweep would cause either the displacement or loss of benthic and finfish resources in the immediate areas of disturbance. This may result in a temporary loss of forage items and a temporary reduction in the amount of benthic habitat available for foraging marine mammals in the immediate proposed project area. However, the amount of habitat affected represents a very small percentage of the available foraging habitat in the proposed project area. It is likely that marine mammals may temporarily shift their foraging efforts to other areas within or around the project area. While this would affect the movements of individual marine mammals, it is likely to be temporary and is not likely to affect marine mammal nourishment or result in any injury or mortality. Increased underwater sound levels may temporarily result in marine mammals avoiding or abandoning the area.</P>
        <P>Because of the temporary nature of the disturbance, the availability of similar habitat and resources in the surrounding area, and the lack of important or unique marine mammal habitat, the impacts to marine mammals and the food sources that they utilize are not expected to cause significant or long-term consequences for individual marine mammals or their populations.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Mitigation</HD>
        <P>In order to issue an incidental take authorization under section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA, NMFS must set forth the permissible methods of taking pursuant to such activity, and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impact on such species or stock and its habitat, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance, and on the availability of such species or stock for taking for certain subsistence uses (where relevant).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Proposed Mitigation Measures</HD>
        <P>With NMFS' input during the application process, DWBI is proposing the following mitigation measures during cable installation operations using DP vessel thruster use. These mitigation measures were also reviewed and approved by NMFS for the BIWF IHA issued in 2014 and amended in June 2015, and are consistent with the terms and conditions of the amended Incidental Take Statement for the Biological Opinion on the Construction and Operation of the Block Island Wind Farm:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Exclusion and Monitoring Zones:</E> Exclusion zones (defined by NMFS as the Level A harassment zone of influence [ZOI] out to the 180/190 dB isopleth) and monitoring zones (defined by NMFS as the Level B harassment ZOI out to the 120 dB isopleth for continuous noise) are typically established to minimize impacts to marine mammals. However, noise analysis has indicated that DP vessel thruster use will not produce sound levels at 180/190 dB at any appreciable distance (see DWBI's Underwater Acoustic Modeling Report in Appendix A of the application). This is consistent with acoustic modeling results for other Atlantic wind farm projects using DP vessel thrusters (Tetra Tech, 2014; DONG Energy, 2016), as well as subsea cable-laying activities using DP vessel thruster use (Quintillion, 2015 and 2016). Therefore, injury to marine mammals is not expected and no Level A harassment exclusion zone is proposed.</P>
        <P>Consultation with NMFS has indicated that the monitoring zones established out to the 120 dB isopleth for continuous noise will result in zones too large to effectively monitor (up to 4.75 km). Therefore, based on precedent set by the U.S. Department of the Navy and recent European legislation regarding compliance thresholds for wind farm construction noise (DoN, 2012; OSPAR, 2008), and consistent with the previous IHA's issued to DWBI and Deepwater Wind Block Island Transmission, L.L.C. (DWBITS), DWBI will establish a monitoring zone equivalent, at a minimum, to the size of the predicted 160 dB isopleth for DP vessel thruster use (5-m radius from the DP vessel) based on DWBI's underwater acoustic modeling. All marine mammal sightings which are visually feasible beyond the 160 dB isopleth will be recorded and potential takes will be noted.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">DP Thruster Power Reduction</E>—During cable installation a constant tension must be maintained to ensure the integrity of the cable. Any significant stoppage in vessel maneuverability during jet plow activities has the potential to result in significant damage to the cable. Therefore, during cable lay if marine mammals enter or approach the established 160 dB isopleth monitoring zone, DWBI proposes to reduce DP thruster to the maximum extent possible, except under circumstances when reducing DP thruster use would compromise safety (both human health and environmental) and/or the integrity of the Project. Reducing thruster energy will effectively reduce the potential for exposure of marine mammals to sound energy. After decreasing thruster energy, protected species observers (PSOs) will continue to monitor marine mammal behavior and determine if the animal(s) is moving towards or away from the established monitoring zone. If the animal(s) continues to move towards the sound source then DP thruster use would remain at the reduced level. Normal thruster use will resume when PSOs report that marine mammals have moved away from and remained clear of the monitoring zone for a minimum of 30 minutes since last the sighting.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Vessel Speed Restrictions</E>—To minimize the potential for vessel collision with North Atlantic right whales and other marine mammals, all DWBI project vessels shall operate at speeds of 10 knots or less from November 1 through April 30.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Ship Strike Avoidance</E>—DWBI shall adhere to NMFS guidelines for marine mammal ship strike avoidance (<E T="03">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/education/viewing_northeast.pdf</E>).</P>

        <P>• The manner in which, and the degree to which, the successful implementation of the measure is expected to minimize adverse impacts to marine mammals;</P>
        <P>• The proven or likely efficacy of the specific measure to minimize adverse impacts as planned; and</P>
        <P>• The practicability of the measure for applicant implementation.</P>
        <P>Any mitigation measure(s) prescribed by NMFS should be able to accomplish, have a reasonable likelihood of accomplishing (based on current science), or contribute to the accomplishment of one or more of the general goals listed here:</P>
        <P>• Avoidance or minimization of injury or death of marine mammals wherever possible (goals 2, 3, and 4 may contribute to this goal).</P>
        <P>• A reduction in the numbers of marine mammals (total number or number at biologically important time or location) exposed to received levels of activities that we expect to result in the take of marine mammals (this goal may contribute to 1, above, or to reducing harassment takes only).</P>
        <P>• A reduction in the number of times (total number or number at biologically important time or location) individuals would be exposed to received levels of activities that we expect to result in the take of marine mammals (this goal may contribute to 1, above, or to reducing harassment takes only).</P>
        <P>• A reduction in the intensity of exposures (either total number or number at biologically important time or location) to received levels of activities that we expect to result in the take of marine mammals (this goal may contribute to a, above, or to reducing the severity of harassment takes only).</P>
        <P>• Avoidance or minimization of adverse effects to marine mammal habitat, paying special attention to the food base, activities that block or limit passage to or from biologically important areas, permanent destruction of habitat, or temporary destruction/disturbance of habitat during a biologically important time.</P>
        <P>• For monitoring directly related to mitigation—an increase in the probability of detecting marine mammals, thus allowing for more effective implementation of the mitigation.</P>
        <P>Based on our evaluation of the applicant's proposed measures, as well as other measures considered by NMFS, NMFS has preliminarily determined that the proposed mitigation measures provide the means of effecting the least practicable impact on marine mammals species or stocks and their habitat, paying particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds, and areas of similar significance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Monitoring and Reporting</HD>
        <P>In order to issue an IHA for an activity, section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA states that NMFS must set forth, “requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking.” The MMPA implementing regulations at 50 CFR 216.104 (a)(13) indicate that requests for ITAs must include the suggested means of accomplishing the necessary monitoring and reporting that will result in increased knowledge of the species and of the level of taking or impacts on populations of marine mammals that are expected to be present in the proposed action area.</P>
        <P>Monitoring measures prescribed by NMFS should accomplish one or more of the following general goals:</P>

        <P>1. An increase in our understanding of the likely occurrence of marine mammal species in the vicinity of the action, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> presence, abundance, distribution, and/or density of species.</P>

        <P>2. An increase in our understanding of the nature, scope, or context of the likely exposure of marine mammal species to any of the potential stressor(s) associated with the action (<E T="03">e.g.</E> sound or visual stimuli), through better understanding of one or more of the following: The action itself and its environment (<E T="03">e.g.</E> sound source characterization, propagation, and ambient noise levels); the affected species (<E T="03">e.g.</E> life history or dive pattern); the likely co-occurrence of marine mammal species with the action (in whole or part) associated with specific adverse effects; and/or the likely biological or behavioral context of exposure to the stressor for the marine mammal (<E T="03">e.g.</E> age class of exposed animals or known pupping, calving or feeding areas).</P>

        <P>3. An increase in our understanding of how individual marine mammals respond (behaviorally or physiologically) to the specific stressors associated with the action (in specific contexts, where possible, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> at what distance or received level).</P>

        <P>4. An increase in our understanding of how anticipated individual responses, to individual stressors or anticipated combinations of stressors, may impact either: The long-term fitness and survival of an individual; or the population, species, or stock (<E T="03">e.g.</E> through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival).</P>

        <P>5. An increase in our understanding of how the activity affects marine mammal habitat, such as through effects on prey sources or acoustic habitat (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> through characterization of longer-term contributions of multiple sound sources to rising ambient noise levels and assessment of the potential chronic effects on marine mammals).</P>
        <P>6. An increase in understanding of the impacts of the activity on marine mammals in combination with the impacts of other anthropogenic activities or natural factors occurring in the region.</P>
        <P>7. An increase in our understanding of the effectiveness of mitigation and monitoring measures.</P>
        <P>8. An increase in the probability of detecting marine mammals (through improved technology or methodology), both specifically within the safety zone (thus allowing for more effective implementation of the mitigation) and in general, to better achieve the above goals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Proposed Monitoring Measures</HD>
        <P>DWBI submitted a marine mammal monitoring and reporting plan as part of the IHA application. The plan may be modified or supplemented based on comments or new information received from the public during the public comment period.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Visual Monitoring</E>—Visual observation of the 160-dB monitoring zone established for DP vessel operation during cable installation will be performed by qualified and NMFS approved protected species observers (PSOs), the resumes of whom will be provided to NMFS for review and approval prior to the start of construction activities. Observer qualifications will include direct field experience on a marine mammal observation vessel and/or aerial surveys in the Atlantic Ocean/Gulf of Mexico. A minimum of two PSOs will be stationed aboard the cable lay vessel. Each PSO will monitor 360 degrees of the field of vision. PSOs stationed on the DP vessel will begin observation of the monitoring zone as the vessel initially leaves the dock. Observations of the monitoring zone will continue throughout the cable installation and will end after the DP vessel has returned to dock.</P>

        <P>Observers would estimate distances to marine mammals visually, using laser range finders, or by using reticle binoculars during daylight hours. During night operations, night vision binoculars will be used. If vantage points higher than 25 ft (7.6 m) are available, distances can be measured using inclinometers. Position data will be recorded using hand-held or vessel global positioning system (GPS) units <PRTPAGE P="22226"/>for each sighting, vessel position change, and any environmental change.</P>
        <P>Each PSO stationed on the cable lay vessel will scan the surrounding area for visual indication of marine mammal presence that may enter the monitoring zone. Observations will take place from the highest available vantage point on the cable lay vessel. General 360-degree scanning will occur during the monitoring periods, and target scanning by the PSO will occur when alerted of a marine mammal presence.</P>

        <P>Data on all observations will be recorded based on standard PSO collection requirements. This will include dates and locations of construction operations; time of observation; location and weather; distance from sound source, DP vessel thruster status (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> energy level); details of marine mammal sightings (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> species, age classification [if known], numbers); details of any observed “taking” (behavioral disturbances or injury/mortality); and reaction of the animal(s) to relevant sound source (if any) and observed behavior, including bearing and direction of travel. All marine mammal sightings which are visually feasible beyond the 160 dB isopleth, will also be recorded and potential takes will be noted.</P>
        <P>In addition, prior to initiation of construction work, all crew members on barges, tugs and support vessels, will undergo environmental training, a component of which will focus on the procedures for sighting and protection of marine mammals. A briefing will also be conducted between the construction supervisors and crews, the PSOs, and DWBI. The purpose of the briefing will be to establish responsibilities of each party, define the chains of command, discuss communication procedures, provide an overview of monitoring purposes, and review operational procedures. The DWBI Construction Compliance Manager (or other authorized individual) will have the authority to stop or delay construction activities, if deemed necessary. New personnel will be briefed as they join the work in progress.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Acoustic Field Verification</E>—DWBI would perform field verification to confirm the 160-dB isopleth monitoring zone. Field verification during cable installation using DP thrusters will be performed using acoustic measurements from two reference locations at two water depths (a depth at mid-water and a depth at approximately 1 m above the seafloor). As necessary, the monitoring zone will be modified to ensure adequate protection to marine mammals.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Proposed Reporting Measures</HD>

        <P>Observers would record dates and locations of construction operations; times of observations; location and weather; details of marine mammal sightings (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> species, age, numbers, behavior); and details of any observed take.</P>
        <P>DWBI proposes to provide the following notifications and reports during construction activities:</P>
        <P>• Notification to NMFS and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) within 24-hours of beginning construction activities and again within 24-hours of completion;</P>
        <P>• The USACE and NMFS should be notified within 24 hours whenever a monitoring zone is re-established by DWBI. After any re-establishment of the monitoring zone, DWBI will provide a report to the USACE and NMFS detailing the field-verification measurements within 7 days. This includes information, such as: a detailed account of the levels, durations, and spectral characteristics of DP thruster use, and the peak, RMS, and energy levels of the sound pulses and their durations as a function of distance, water depth, and tidal cycle. The USACE and NMFS will be notified within 24 hours if field verification measurements suggest a larger DP thruster power reduction zone.</P>
        <P>• Within 120 days after completion of the construction activities, a final technical report will be provided to USACE, and NMFS that fully documents the methods and monitoring protocols, summarizes the data recorded during monitoring, estimates the number of marine mammals that may have been taken during construction activities, and provides an interpretation of the results and effectiveness of all monitoring tasks</P>
        <P>• <E T="03">Notification of Injured or Dead Marine Mammals</E>—In the unanticipated event that the specified activities clearly causes the take of a marine mammal in a manner prohibited by the IHA, such as a serious injury, or mortality (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> ship-strike, gear interaction, and/or entanglement), DWBI would immediately cease the specified activities and report the incident to the Chief of the Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources and the NOAA Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office (GARFO) Stranding Coordinator. The report would include the following information:</P>
        <P>○ Time, date, and location (latitude/longitude) of the incident;</P>
        <P>○ Name and type of vessel involved;</P>
        <P>○ Vessel's speed during and leading up to the incident;</P>
        <P>○ Description of the incident;</P>
        <P>○ Status of all sound source use in the 24 hours preceding the incident;</P>
        <P>○ Water depth;</P>
        <P>○ Environmental conditions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> wind speed and direction, Beaufort sea state, cloud cover, and visibility);</P>
        <P>○ Description of all marine mammal observations in the 24 hours preceding the incident;</P>
        <P>○ Species identification or description of the animal(s) involved;</P>
        <P>○ Fate of the animal(s); and</P>
        <P>○ Photographs or video footage of the animal(s) (if equipment is available).</P>
        <P>Activities would not resume until NMFS is able to review the circumstances of the event. NMFS would work with DWBI to minimize reoccurrence of such an event in the future. DWBI would not resume activities until notified by NMFS.</P>

        <P>In the event that DWBI discovers an injured or dead marine mammal and determines that the cause of the injury or death is unknown and the death is relatively recent (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> in less than a moderate state of decomposition), DWBI would immediately report the incident to the Chief of the Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources and the GARFO Stranding Coordinator. The report would include the same information identified in the paragraph above. Activities would be able to continue while NMFS reviews the circumstances of the incident. NMFS would work with the Applicant to determine if modifications in the activities are appropriate.</P>

        <P>In the event that DWBI discovers an injured or dead marine mammal and determines that the injury or death is not associated with or related to the activities authorized in the IHA (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> previously wounded animal, carcass with moderate to advanced decomposition, or scavenger damage), DWBI would report the incident to the Chief of the Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, and the NMFS Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office Regional Stranding Coordinator, within 24 hours of the discovery. DWBI would provide photographs or video footage (if available) or other documentation of the stranded animal sighting to NMFS. DWBI can continue its operations under such a case.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Estimated Take by Incidental Harassment</HD>

        <P>Except with respect to certain activities not pertinent here, the MMPA defines “harassment” as: Any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance which (i) has the potential to injure a marine <PRTPAGE P="22227"/>mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild [Level A harassment]; or (ii) has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering [Level B harassment].</P>
        <P>Underwater sound associated with the use of DP vessel thrusters during inter-array and export cable installation is the only project activity that has the potential to harass marine mammals, as defined by the MMPA. Harassment could take the form of temporary threshold shift, avoidance, or other changes in marine mammal behavior. NMFS anticipates that impacts to marine mammals would be in the form of Level B behavioral harassment and no take by injury, serious injury, or mortality is proposed. NMFS does not anticipate take resulting from the movement of vessels (i., vessel strike) associated with construction because there will be a limited number of vessels moving at slow speeds over a relatively shallow, nearshore area, and PSOs on the vessels will be monitoring for marine mammals and will be able to alert the vessels to avoid any marine mammals in the area.</P>
        <P>NMFS' current acoustic exposure criteria for estimating take are shown in Table 3 below. DWBI's modeled distances to these acoustic exposure criteria are shown in Table 4. Details on the model characteristics and results are provided in the Underwater Acoustic Modeling Report found in Appendix A of the application. As discussed in the application and in Appendix A, acoustic modeling took into consideration sound sources using the loudest potential operational parameters, bathymetry, geoacoustic properties of the project area, time of year, and marine mammal hearing ranges. Results from the acoustic modeling showed that estimated maximum critical distance to the 120 dB re 1 μPa (rms) MMPA threshold was approximately 4,750 m for 10-m water depth, 4,275 m for 20-m water depth, and 3,575 m for 40-m water depth. More information on results including figures displaying critical distance information can be found in Appendix A. DWBI and NMFS believe that these estimates represent the worst-case scenario and that the actual distances to the Level B harassment threshold may be shorter. DP vessel thruster use will not produce sound levels at 180/190 dB at any appreciable distance; therefore, no injurious (Level A harassment) takes have been requested or are being proposed for authorization. To verify the distance to the MMPA thresholds calculated by underwater acoustic modeling, DWBI has committed to conducting real-time underwater acoustic measurements of the DP vessel thrusters. Field verification of actual sound propagation will enable adjustment of the MMPA threshold level distances to fit actual construction conditions, if necessary.</P>

        <P>DWBI estimated species densities within the proposed project area in order to estimate the number of marine mammal exposures to sound levels above 120 dB (continuous noise). The data used as the basis for estimating species density for the project area are sightings per unit effort (SPUE) taken from Kenney and Vigness-Raposa (2009). SPUE (or, the relative abundance of species) is derived by using a measure of survey effort and number of individual cetaceans sighted. SPUE allows for comparison between discrete units of time (<E T="03">i.e.</E> seasons) and space within a project area (Shoop and Kenney, 1992). SPUE calculated by Kenney and Vigness-Raposa (2009) was derived from a number of sources including: (1) North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium database; (2) CeTAP (CeTAP, 1982); (3) sightings data from the Coastal Research and Education Society of Long Island, Inc. and Okeanos Ocean Research Foundation; (4) the Northeast Regional Stranding network (marine mammals); and (5) the NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center's Fisheries Sampling Branch (Woods Hole, MA).</P>

        <P>The Northeast Navy Operations Area (OPAREA) Density Estimates (DoN, 2007) were also used in support for estimating take for seals, which represents the only available comprehensive data for seal abundance. However, abundance estimates for the Southern New England area includes breeding populations on Cape Cod, and therefore using this dataset alone will result in a substantial over-estimate of take in the Project Area. However, based on reports conducted by Kenney and Vigness-Raposa (2009), Schroeder (2000), and Ronald and Gots (2003), <PRTPAGE P="22228"/>harbor seal abundance off the Southern New England coast in the vicinity of the survey is likely to be approximately 20 percent of the total abundance. In addition, because the seasonality of, and habitat use by, gray seals roughly overlaps with harbor seals, the same abundance assumption of 20 percent of the southern New England population of gray seals can be applied when estimating abundance. Per this data, take due to Level B harassment for harbor seals and gray seals have been calculated based on 20 percent of the Northeast Navy OPAREA abundance estimates and resulting adjusted density values.</P>

        <P>The methodology for calculating takes is the same as that described in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice for the original 2014 (modified in 2015) BIWF IHA. Estimated takes were calculated by multiplying the maximum species density (per 100 km<SU>2</SU>) by the zone of influence (ZOI), multiplied by a correction factor of 1.5 to account for marine mammals underwater, multiplied by the number of days of the specified activity.</P>

        <P>A detailed description of the model used to calculate zones of influence is provided in the Underwater Acoustic Modeling Report found in Appendix A of the application. Acoustic modeling was completed with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory's Range-dependent Acoustic Model (RAM) which is widely used by sound engineers and marine biologists due to its adaptability to describe highly complex acoustic scenarios. This modeling analysis method considers range and depth along with a geo-referenced dataset to automatically retrieve the time of year information, bathymetry, and geoacoustic properties (<E T="03">e.g.</E> hard rock, sand, mud) along propagation transects radiating from the sound source. Transects are run along compass points (45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°, and 360°) to determine received sound levels at a given location. These values are then summed across frequencies to provide broadband received levels at the MMPA Level A and Level B harassment thresholds as described in Table 3. The representative area ensonified to the MMPA Level B threshold for DP vessel thruster use during cable installation was used to estimate take. The distances to the MMPA thresholds were used to conservatively estimate how many marine mammals would receive a specified amount of sound energy in a given time period and to support the development of monitoring and/or mitigation measures.</P>
        <P>DWBI used a ZOI of 9.7 mi<SU>2</SU> (25.1 km<SU>2</SU>) and a maximum installation period of 28 days to estimate take from use of the DP vessel thruster during cable installation. The ZOI represents the average ensonified area across the three representative water depths (10 m, 20 m, and 40 m) along a 13.2-km cable route. DWBI expects cable installation to occur between May and October. To be conservative, take calculations were based on the highest seasonal species density when cable installation may occur (see Table 5). The resulting take estimates (rounded to the nearest whole number) based upon these conservative assumptions for North Atlantic right, humpback, fin, and minke whales, as well as, short-beaked common and Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbor porpoise, and harbor and gray seals are presented in Table 5. These numbers represent less than 1.5 percent of the stock for these species, respectively (Table 5). These percentages are the upper boundary of the animal population that could be affected.</P>

        <P>DWBI's requested take numbers are provided in Table 5 and this is also the number of takes NMFS is proposing to authorize. DWBI's take calculations do not take into account whether a single animal is harassed multiple times or whether each exposure is a different animal. Therefore, the numbers in Table 5 are the maximum number of animals that may be harassed during the cable installation activities (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> DWBI assumes that each exposure event is a different animal). These estimates do not account for prescribed mitigation measures that DWBI would implement during the specified activities and the fact that powerdown procedures shall be implemented if an animal enters the Level B harassment zone (160 dB), further reducing the potential for any takes to occur during these activities.</P>

        <P>DWBI did not request, and NMFS is not proposing, take from vessel strike. We do not anticipate marine mammals to be impacted by vessel movement because a limited number of vessels would be involved in construction activities and they would mostly move at slow speeds during DP vessel thruster use during cable installation activities. However, DWBI shall implement measures (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> vessel speed restrictions and separation distances; see <E T="03">Proposed Mitigation Measures</E>) to further minimize potential impacts to marine mammals from vessel strikes during vessel operations and transit in the project area.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Analysis and Determinations</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Negligible Impact</HD>

        <P>Negligible impact is “an impact resulting from the specified activity that cannot be reasonably expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affect the species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival” (50 CFR 216.103). A negligible impact finding is based on the lack of likely adverse effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> population-level effects). An estimate of the number of takes, alone, is not enough information on which to base an impact <PRTPAGE P="22229"/>determination, as the severity of harassment may vary greatly depending on the context and duration of the behavioral response, many of which would not be expected to have deleterious impacts on the fitness of any individuals. In determining whether the expected takes will have a negligible impact, in addition to considering estimates of the number of marine mammals that might be “taken,” NMFS must consider other factors, such as the likely nature of any responses (their intensity, duration, etc.), the context of any responses (critical reproductive time or location, migration, etc.), as well as the number and nature of estimated Level A harassment takes, the number of estimated mortalities, and the status of the species.</P>
        <P>To avoid repetition, the discussion of our analyses applies to all the species listed in Table 5, given that the anticipated effects of this activity on these different marine mammal stocks are expected to be similar. There is no information about the nature or severity of the impacts, or the size, status, or structure of any of these species or stocks that would lead to a different analysis for this activity.</P>

        <P>As discussed in the Potential Effects section, permanent threshold shift, masking, non-auditory physical effects, and vessel strike are not expected to occur. There is some potential for limited TTS; however, animals in the area would likely incur no more than brief hearing impairment (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> TTS) due to low source levels and the fact that most marine mammals would more likely avoid a loud sound source rather than swim in such close proximity as to result in TTS. Moreover, as the DP vessel is continually moving along the cable route over a 24-hour period, the area within the 120 dB isopleth is constantly moving (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> transient sound field) and shifting within a 24-hour period. Therefore, no single area in Rhode Island Sound will have noise levels above 120 dB for more than a few hours; once an area has been surveyed, it is not likely that it will be surveyed again, therefore reducing the likelihood of repeated impacts within the project area.</P>
        <P>Potential impacts to marine mammal habitat were discussed previously in this document (see the Anticipated Effects on Habitat section). Marine mammal habitat may be impacted by elevated sound levels and some sediment disturbance, but these impacts would be temporary. Feeding behavior is not likely to be significantly impacted. Prey species are mobile, and are broadly distributed throughout the project area; therefore, marine mammals that may be temporarily displaced during survey activities are expected to be able to resume foraging once they have moved away from areas with disturbing levels of underwater noise. Because of the temporary nature of the disturbance, the availability of similar habitat and resources in the surrounding area, and the lack of important or unique marine mammal habitat, the impacts to marine mammals and the food sources that they utilize are not expected to cause significant or long-term consequences for individual marine mammals or their populations. There are no feeding areas known to be biologically important to marine mammals within the proposed project area.</P>

        <P>There are no rookeries or mating grounds known to be biologically important to marine mammals within the proposed project area. ESA-listed species for which takes are proposed are North Atlantic right, humpback, and fin whales. Recent estimates of abundance indicate a stable or growing humpback whale population, while examination of the minimum number alive population index calculated from the individual sightings database for the years 1990-2010 suggests a positive and slowly accelerating trend in North Atlantic right whale population size (Waring <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2015). There are currently insufficient data to determine population trends for fin whale) (Waring <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2015). There is no designated critical habitat for any ESA-listed marine mammals within the project area, and none of the stocks for non-listed species proposed to be taken are considered “depleted” or “strategic” by NMFS under the MMPA.</P>

        <P>The proposed mitigation measures are expected to reduce the potential for exposure of marine mammals by reducing the DP thruster power if a marine mammal is observed within the 160 dB isopleth monitoring zone. Additional vessel strike avoidance requirements will further mitigate potential impacts to marine mammals during vessel transit in the Study Area. DWBI vessels associated with the BIWF construction will adhere to NMFS guidelines for marine mammal ship striking avoidance (available online at: <E T="03">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/education/viewing_northeast.pdf</E>), including maintaining a distance of at least 1,500 feet from right whales and having dedicated protected species observers who will communicate with the captain to ensure that all measures to avoid whales are taken. NMFS believes that the size of right whales, their slow movements, and the amount of time they spend at the surface will make them extremely likely to be spotted by protected species observers during construction activities within the project area.</P>

        <P>DWBI did not request, and NMFS is not proposing, take of marine mammals by injury, serious injury, or mortality. NMFS expects that all takes would be in the form of short-term Level B behavioral harassment in the form of brief startling reaction and/or temporary vacating of the area, or decreased foraging (if such activity were occurring)—reactions that are considered to be of low severity and with no lasting biological consequences (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Southall <E T="03">et al.,</E> 2007). This is largely due to the short time scale of the proposed activities and the nature of the DP vessel noise (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> low source level, constantly moving resulting in a transient sound field), as well as the required mitigation.</P>
        <P>Based on best available science, NMFS preliminarily concludes that exposures to marine mammal species and stocks due to DWBI's DP vessel thruster use during cable installation activities would result in only short-term (temporary and short in duration) and relatively infrequent effects to individuals exposed, and not of the type or severity that would be expected to be additive for the very small portion of the stocks and species likely to be exposed. Given the intensity of the activities, and the fact that shipping contributes to the ambient sound levels in the surrounding waters, NMFS does not anticipate the proposed take estimates to impact annual rates of recruitment or survival. Animals may temporarily avoid the immediate area, but are not expected to permanently abandon the area. Major shifts in habitat use, distribution, or foraging success, are not expected.</P>
        <P>Based on the analysis contained herein of the likely effects of the specified activity on marine mammals and their habitat, and taking into consideration the implementation of the proposed monitoring and mitigation measures, NMFS preliminarily finds that the total marine mammal take from DWBI's DP vessel thruster use during cable installation activities will have a negligible impact on the affected marine mammal species or stocks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Small Numbers</HD>

        <P>The requested takes proposed to be authorized for the cable installation activities utilizing DP vessel thrusters represent 0.22 percent of the Western North Atlantic (WNA) stock of North Atlantic right whale, 0.24 percent of the Gulf of Maine stock of humpback whale, 1.42 percent of the WNA stock of fin whale, 0.02 percent of the Canadian East <PRTPAGE P="22230"/>Coast stock of minke whale, 0.07 percent of the WNA stock of short-beaked common dolphin, 0.16 percent of the WNA stock of Atlantic white-sided dolphin, 0.01 percent of the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy stock of harbor porpoise, 0.03 percent of the WNA stock of harbor seal, and 0.01 percent of the North Atlantic stock of gray seal. These take estimates represent the percentage of each species or stock that could be taken by Level B behavioral harassment and represent extremely small numbers (less than 1.5 percent) relative to the affected species or stock sizes. Further, the proposed take numbers are the maximum numbers of animals that are expected to be harassed during the project; it is possible that some of these exposures may occur to the same individual. Therefore, NMFS preliminarily finds that small numbers of marine mammals will be taken relative to the populations of the affected species or stocks.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Impact on Availability of Affected Species for Taking for Subsistence Uses</HD>
        <P>There are no relevant subsistence uses of marine mammals implicated by this action. Therefore, NMFS has determined that the total taking of affected species or stocks would not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such species or stocks for taking for subsistence purposes.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Endangered Species Act</HD>
        <P>There are three marine mammal species that are listed as endangered under the ESA: Fin whale, humpback whale, and North Atlantic right whale. Under section 7 of the ESA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the federal permitting agency for the actual construction) consulted with NMFS on the proposed BIWF project. NMFS also consulted internally on the issuance of an IHA under section 101(a)(5)(D) of the MMPA for this activity. NMFS' Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office (GARFO) issued a Biological Opinion on January 30, 2014 which was amended on June 5, 2015, concluding that the Block Island Wind Farm project may adversely affect but is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of fin whale, humpback whale, or North Atlantic right whale.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">National Environmental Policy Act</HD>
        <P>NMFS conducted the required analysis under NEPA and prepared an EA for its issuance of the original BIWF IHA, issuing a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the action on August 21, 2014 (reaffirmed on June 9, 2015). The potential environmental impacts of the proposed IHA are within the scope of the environmental impacts analyzed in the NMFS' EA, which was used to support NMFS' FONSI. NMFS has determined that there are no substantial changes to the action and that there are no new direct, indirect, or cumulative effects to the human environment resulting from the IHA modifications. Therefore, NMFS has determined that a new or supplemental EA or Environmental Impact Statement are unnecessary, and reaffirms the existing FONSI for this action.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Authorization</HD>
        <P>As a result of these preliminary determinations, NMFS proposes to issue an Incidental Harassment Authorization (IHA) to DWBI for cable installation activities that use DP vessel thrusters from May 2016 through April 2017, provided the previously mentioned mitigation, monitoring, and reporting requirements are incorporated. The proposed IHA language is provided next.</P>
        <P>This section contains a draft of the IHA itself. The wording contained in this section is proposed for inclusion in the IHA (if issued).</P>
        <P>Deepwater Wind Block Island, LLC, 56 Exchange Terrace, Suite 101, Providence, RI, 02903-1772, is hereby authorized under section 101(a)(5)(D) of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(5)(D)) and 50 CFR 216.107, to harass marine mammals incidental to dynamic positioning vessel thruster use associated with inter-array and export cable installation activities off the southeast coast of Block Island, Rhode Island.</P>
        <P>1. This Authorization is valid from May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2017.</P>
        <P>2. This Authorization is valid only for DP vessel thruster use associated with cable installation activities, as described in the IHA application.</P>

        <P>3. The holder of this authorization (Holder) is hereby authorized to take, by Level B harassment only, 13 Atlantic white-sided dolphins (<E T="03">Lagenorhynchus acutus</E>), 28 short-beaked common dolphins (<E T="03">Delphinus delphis</E>), 8 harbor porpoises (<E T="03">Phocoena phocoena</E>), 2 minke whales (<E T="03">Balaenoptera acutorostrata</E>), 23 fin whales (<E T="03">Balaenoptera physalus</E>), 2 humpback whales (<E T="03">Megaptera novaeangliae</E>), 1 North Atlantic right whales (<E T="03">Eubalaena glacialis</E>), 30 gray seals (<E T="03">Halichoerus grypus</E>), and 21 harbor seals (<E T="03">Phoca vitulina</E>) incidental to the Block Island Wind Farm inter-array and export cable installation activities using dynamic positioning (DP) vessel thrusters.</P>
        <P>4. The taking of any marine mammal in a manner prohibited under this IHA must be reported immediately to NMFS' Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office (GARFO), 55 Great Republic Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930-2276; phone 978-281-9300, and NMFS' Office of Protected Resources, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910; phone 301-427-8401.</P>
        <P>5. The Holder or designees must notify NMFS' GARFO and Office of Protected Resources (Headquarters) at least 24 hours prior to the seasonal commencement of the specified activity (see contact information in 4 above).</P>

        <P>6. The holder of this Authorization must notify the Chief of the Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources, or her designee at least 24 hours prior to the start of survey activities (unless constrained by the date of issuance of this Authorization in which case notification shall be made as soon as possible) at 301-427-8401 or to <E T="03">John.Fiorentino@noaa.gov.</E>
        </P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">7. Mitigation Requirements</FP>
        
        <P>The Holder is required to abide by the following mitigation conditions listed in 7(a)-(c). Failure to comply with these conditions may result in the modification, suspension, or revocation of this IHA.</P>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">DP Thruster Power Reduction</E>—During cable installation, if marine mammals enter or approach the established 160 dB isopleth monitoring zone, DWBI shall reduce DP thruster to the maximum extent possible, except under circumstances when reducing DP thruster use would compromise safety (both human health and environmental) and/or the integrity of the Project. After decreasing thruster energy, protected species observers (PSOs) will continue to monitor marine mammal behavior and determine if the animal(s) is moving towards or away from the established monitoring zone. If the animal(s) continues to move towards the sound source then DP thruster use would remain at the reduced level. Normal thruster use will resume when PSOs report that marine mammals have moved away from and remained clear of the monitoring zone for a minimum of 30 minutes since last the sighting.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Vessel Speed Restrictions:</E> All project vessels shall operate at speeds of 10 knots or less from November 1 through April 30.</P>
        <P>(c) <E T="03">Ship Strike Avoidance:</E> The Holder shall adhere to NMFS guidelines for marine mammal ship strike avoidance (<E T="03">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/education/viewing_northeast.pdf</E>).</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">8. Monitoring Requirements</FP>
        

        <P>The Holder is required to abide by the following monitoring conditions listed in 8(a)-(b). Failure to comply with these conditions may result in the <PRTPAGE P="22231"/>modification, suspension, or revocation of this IHA.</P>
        <P>(a) <E T="03">Visual Monitoring</E>—Visual observation of the 160-dB monitoring zone will be performed by qualified and NMFS approved protected species observers (PSOs). Observer qualifications will include direct field experience on a marine mammal observation vessel and/or aerial surveys in the Atlantic Ocean/Gulf of Mexico. A minimum of two PSOs will be stationed aboard the DP vessel. Each PSO will monitor 360 degrees of the field of vision. PSOs stationed on the DP vessel will begin observation of the monitoring zone as the vessel initially leaves the dock. Observations of the monitoring zone will continue throughout the cable installation and will end after the DP vessel has returned to dock. Observers would estimate distances to marine mammals visually, using laser range finders, or by using reticle binoculars during daylight hours. During night operations, night vision binoculars will be used. Position data will be recorded using hand-held or vessel global positioning system (GPS) units for each sighting, vessel position change, and any environmental change. Each PSO stationed on the cable lay vessel will scan the surrounding area for visual indication of marine mammal presence that may enter the monitoring zone. Observations will take place from the highest available vantage point on the cable lay vessel. General 360-degree scanning will occur during the monitoring periods, and target scanning by the PSO will occur when alerted of a marine mammal presence. Information recorded during each observation shall be used to estimate numbers of animals potentially taken and shall include the following:</P>
        <P>• Dates and locations of construction operations;</P>
        <P>• Number of observations;</P>
        <P>• Time and frequency of observations;</P>
        <P>• Location (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> distance from sound source);</P>
        <P>• DP vessel thruster status (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> energy level)</P>
        <P>• Weather conditions;</P>
        <P>• Details of mammal sightings (species, age classification [if known], numbers)</P>
        <P>• Reaction of the animal(s) to relevant sound source (if any) and observed behavior, including bearing and direction of travel; and</P>
        <P>• Details of any observed “taking” (behavioral disturbances or injury/mortality;</P>
        <P>All marine mammal sightings which are visually feasible beyond the 160 dB isopleth, shall also be recorded and potential takes shall be noted.</P>
        <P>(b) <E T="03">Acoustic Field Verification</E>—DWBI would perform field verification to confirm the 160-dB isopleth monitoring zone. Field verification during cable installation using DP thrusters will be performed using acoustic measurements from two reference locations at two water depths (a depth at mid-water and a depth at approximately 1 m above the seafloor). As necessary, the monitoring zone will be modified to ensure adequate protection to marine mammals.</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">9. Reporting Requirements</FP>
        
        <P>(a) The Holder shall provide the following notifications during construction activities:</P>
        <P>• Notification to NMFS and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) within 24-hours of beginning construction activities and again within 24-hours of completion</P>
        <P>• The USACE and NMFS shall be notified within 24 hours whenever a monitoring zone is re-established by DWBI. After any re-establishment of the monitoring zone, DWBI will provide a report to the USACE and NMFS detailing the field-verification measurements within 7 days. This shall include the following information: a detailed account of the levels, durations, and spectral characteristics of DP thruster use, and the peak, RMS, and energy levels of the sound pulses and their durations as a function of distance, water depth, and tidal cycle. The USACE and NMFS will be notified within 24 hours if field verification measurements suggest a larger DP thruster power reduction zone. Implementation of a smaller zone shall be contingent on NMFS' review and shall not be used until NMFS approves the change.</P>
        <P>• <E T="03">Notification of Injured or Dead Marine Mammals</E>—In the unanticipated event that the specified activities clearly causes the take of a marine mammal in a manner prohibited by the IHA, such as a serious injury, or mortality (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> ship-strike, gear interaction, and/or entanglement), DWBI would immediately cease the specified activities and report the incident to the Chief of the Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources and the NOAA Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office (GARFO) Stranding Coordinator. The report would include the following information:</P>
        <P>○ Time, date, and location (latitude/longitude) of the incident;</P>
        <P>○ Name and type of vessel involved;</P>
        <P>○ Vessel's speed during and leading up to the incident;</P>
        <P>○ Description of the incident;</P>
        <P>○ Status of all sound source use in the 24 hours preceding the incident;</P>
        <P>○ Water depth;</P>
        <P>○ Environmental conditions (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> wind speed and direction, Beaufort sea state, cloud cover, and visibility);</P>
        <P>○ Description of all marine mammal observations in the 24 hours preceding the incident;</P>
        <P>○ Species identification or description of the animal(s) involved;</P>
        <P>○ Fate of the animal(s); and</P>
        <P>○ Photographs or video footage of the animal(s) (if equipment is available).</P>
        <P>Activities would not resume until NMFS is able to review the circumstances of the event. NMFS would work with DWBI to minimize reoccurrence of such an event in the future. DWBI would not resume activities until notified by NMFS.</P>

        <P>In the event that DWBI discovers an injured or dead marine mammal and determines that the cause of the injury or death is unknown and the death is relatively recent (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> in less than a moderate state of decomposition), DWBI would immediately report the incident to the Chief of the Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources and the GARFO Stranding Coordinator. The report would include the same information identified in the paragraph above. Activities would be able to continue while NMFS reviews the circumstances of the incident. NMFS would work with the Applicant to determine if modifications in the activities are appropriate.</P>

        <P>In the event that DWBI discovers an injured or dead marine mammal and determines that the injury or death is not associated with or related to the activities authorized in the IHA (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> previously wounded animal, carcass with moderate to advanced decomposition, or scavenger damage), DWBI would report the incident to the Chief of the Permits and Conservation Division, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, and the NMFS Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office Regional Stranding Coordinator, within 24 hours of the discovery. DWBI would provide photographs or video footage (if available) or other documentation of the stranded animal sighting to NMFS. DWBI can continue its operations under such a case.</P>

        <P>(b) The Holder shall provide a final technical report to USACE and NMFS, within 120 days after completion of the construction activities, that fully documents the methods and monitoring protocols, summarizes the data recorded during monitoring, estimates the number of marine mammals that may <PRTPAGE P="22232"/>have been taken during construction activities, and provides an interpretation of the results and effectiveness of all monitoring tasks. The report shall contain the following information:</P>
        <P>• A summary of the activity and monitoring plan (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> dates, times, locations);</P>
        <P>• A summary of mitigation implementation;</P>
        <P>• Monitoring results and a summary that addresses the goals of the monitoring plan, including the following:</P>
        <P>○ Environmental conditions when observations were made:</P>
        <P>○ Water conditions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> Beaufort sea-state, tidal state)</P>
        <P>○ Weather conditions (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> percent cloud cover, visibility, percent glare)</P>
        <P>○ Date and time survey initiated and terminated</P>
        <P>○ Date, time, number, species, age, and any other relevant data regarding marine mammals observed</P>
        <P>○ Description of the observed behaviors (in both the presence and absence of activities):</P>
        <P> If possible, the correlation to underwater sound level occurring at the time of any observable behavior</P>
        <P>• Estimated exposure/take numbers during activities; and</P>
        <P>• An assessment of the implementation and effectiveness of prescribed mitigation and monitoring measures.</P>
        <P>10. This Authorization may be modified, suspended, or withdrawn if the Holder fails to abide by the conditions prescribed herein or if the authorized taking is having more than a negligible impact on the species or stock of affected marine mammals, or if there is an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of such species or stocks for subsistence uses.</P>
        <P>11. A copy of this Authorization and the Incidental Take Statement must be in the possession of each vessel operator taking marine mammals under the authority of this Incidental Harassment Authorization.</P>
        <P>12. The Holder is required to comply with the Terms and Conditions of the Incidental Take Statement corresponding to NMFS' Biological Opinion.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>

        <P>The USPTO held a roundtable on March 5, 2014 (“Roundtable”), to solicit public opinion regarding the written description requirement of 35 U.S.C. 112(a), or pre-America Invents Act (“AIA”) 35 U.S.C. 112, para. 1 (“35 U.S.C. 112(a)”) as applied to design applications in certain limited situations. Specifically, the USPTO sought comments on the application of the written description requirement to an amended claim or a claim in a continuing design application (“later-claimed design”) that includes only a subset of originally disclosed elements (the later-claimed design does not introduce any new elements that were not originally disclosed). <E T="03">See Request for Comments and Notice of Roundtable Event on the Written Description Requirement for Design Applications</E>, 79 FR 7171 (Feb. 6, 2014) (“the Notice”). As discussed in the Notice, it has been the experience of the USPTO that in the vast majority of cases there is no question that a later-claimed design, composed of only a subset of originally disclosed elements, satisfies the written description requirement. In certain limited situations, however, the subset of originally disclosed elements, although visible in the original disclosure, composes a later-claimed design that an ordinary designer might not have recognized in the original disclosure. In those certain limited situations, a question arises as to whether the later-claimed design satisfies the written description requirement.</P>

        <P>In the Notice, the USPTO requested input on its proposed factors-based approach, in which design examiners would consider certain enumerated factors when evaluating a claim for compliance with the written description requirement. The Roundtable featured public presentations and discussion of the topics identified in the Notice. The USPTO also received written comments on the topics identified in the Notice and discussed at the Roundtable. Details of the Roundtable, as well as the public presentations, the USPTO's examples presented for discussion, the webcast recording, and the written comments received are available at <E T="03">http://www.uspto.gov/patent/contact-patents/roundtable-written-description-requirement-design-applications.</E>
        </P>

        <P>The USPTO considered all of the comments, both those expressed at the Roundtable and those received in writing. Responsive to these comments, the USPTO has decided not to pursue the factors-based approach set forth in the Notice. Also, in view of the comments, it became clear that there exists a need to supplement the current provisions in the <E T="03">Manual of Patent Examining Procedure</E> (“MPEP”) relating to 35 U.S.C. 112 for design applications. A majority of the comments urged that the USPTO focus on precedent from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”) pertaining to written description issues in the context of design patents and applications. Specific emphasis was placed on <E T="03">Racing Strollers Inc.</E> v.<E T="03"> TRI Industries Inc.</E>, 878 F.2d 1418 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (<E T="03">en banc</E>) and <E T="03">In re Daniels</E>, 144 F.3d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Most comments suggested that these cases establish “a simple visual test” for determining compliance with the written description requirement; that is, the written description requirement is satisfied because the elements of the later-claimed design are visible in the original disclosure. Several comments also addressed <E T="03">In re Owens</E>, 710 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In developing the proposed approach set forth in section III of this notice, the USPTO considered these Federal Circuit design cases, along with other seminal Federal Circuit cases concerning the written description requirement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. General Principles Governing Compliance With the Written Description Requirement for Design Applications</HD>

        <P>35 U.S.C. 112(a) provides that “[t]he specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same . . . .” The Federal Circuit has explained that “requiring a written description of the invention plays a vital role in curtailing claims . . . that have not been invented, and thus cannot be described.” <E T="03">Ariad Pharms., Inc.</E> v.<E T="03"> Eli Lilly &amp; Co.</E>, 598 F.3d 1336, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (<E T="03">en banc</E>). Further, “the purpose of the written description requirement is to `ensure that the scope of the right to exclude, as set forth in the claims, does not overreach the scope of the inventor's contribution to the field of art as described in the patent specification.' ” <E T="03">Id.,</E> 598 F.3d at 1353-54 (citations omitted).</P>

        <P>In evaluating written description, “the test for sufficiency is whether the disclosure of the application relied upon reasonably conveys to those skilled in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter as of the filing date.” <E T="03">Id.</E>, 598 F.3d at 1351 (citations omitted). <E T="03">See also</E>
          <E T="03">Daniels</E>, 144 F.3d at 1456. With respect to showing possession, the Federal Circuit has emphasized that “the hallmark of written description is disclosure” and “[t]hus, `possession as <PRTPAGE P="22235"/>shown in the disclosure' is a more complete formulation.” <E T="03">Ariad</E>, 598 F.3d at 1351. Accordingly, “the test requires an objective inquiry into the four corners of the specification from the perspective of a person of ordinary skill in the art” and “[b]ased on that inquiry, the specification must describe an invention understandable to that skilled artisan and show that the inventor actually invented the invention claimed.” <E T="03">Id.</E>
        </P>

        <P>The test for sufficiency of written description is the same for design and utility patents. <E T="03">Daniels</E>, 144 F.3d at 1456. For designs, “[i]t is the drawings of the design patent that provide the description of the invention.” <E T="03">Id.</E> (stating, “Although linguists distinguish between a drawing and a writing, the drawings of the design patent are viewed in terms of the `written description' requirement of Section 112.”).</P>
        <P>In <E T="03">Racing Strollers</E>, the Federal Circuit stated, “[a]s a practical matter, meeting the [written description] requirement of § 112 is, in the case of an ornamental design, simply a question of whether the earlier application contains illustrations, whatever form they may take, depicting the ornamental design illustrated in the later application and claimed therein . . . .” <E T="03">Racing Strollers</E>, 878 F.2d at 1420. Subsequent cases explain that the written description analysis must be conducted from the perspective of an ordinary designer. For example, in finding that the inventor in <E T="03">Daniels</E> had possession of a later-claimed design to a leecher without leaf ornamentation where an earlier design application depicted the leecher with leaf ornamentation, the Federal Circuit stated, “The leecher as an article of manufacture is clearly visible in the earlier design application, <E T="03">demonstrating to the artisan viewing that application</E> that [the inventor] had possession at that time of the later claimed design of that article . . . .” <E T="03">Daniels,</E> 144 F.3d at 1456-57 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</P>
        <P>This principle is articulated again in <E T="03">Owens,</E> where the Federal Circuit found that a parent application disclosing a design for a bottle with an undivided pentagonal center-front panel did not provide written description support for a continuation claiming only the trapezoidal top portion of the center-front panel. <E T="03">Owens,</E> 710 F.3d at 1368. Specifically, the Federal Circuit stated that “the question for written description purposes <E T="03">is whether a skilled artisan would recognize</E> upon reading the parent's disclosure that the trapezoidal top portion of the front panel might be claimed separately from the remainder of that area.” <E T="03">Owens,</E> 710 F.3d at 1368 (citing <E T="03">Ariad,</E> 598 F.3d at 1351) (emphasis added). These design cases are consistent with the written description case law requiring that the application relied upon must reasonably convey to a person of skill in the art that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter. <E T="03">See Ariad,</E> 598 F.3d at 1351 (stating, “the test requires an objective inquiry into the four corners of the specification from the perspective of a person of ordinary skill in the art” and “[b]ased on that inquiry, the specification must describe an invention understandable to that skilled artisan and show that the inventor actually invented the invention claimed.”).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Applying the General Principles to Specific Situations in Design Applications Where Issues of Compliance With the Written Description Requirement May Arise</HD>

        <P>A question as to whether the original or earlier disclosure of a design provides an adequate written description may arise when an amended claim is presented, or where a claim to entitlement of an earlier priority date or effective filing date (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> under 35 U.S.C. 120) has been made. A continuation application must comply with the written description requirement to be entitled to a parent application's effective filing date. <E T="03">See Owens,</E> 710 F.3d at 1366 (citing <E T="03">Daniels,</E> 144 F.3d at 1456). Similarly, an amended claim must find written description support in the original disclosure. In determining whether a claim complies with the written description requirement, an examiner would bear in mind that “the written description question does not turn upon what has been disclaimed, but instead upon whether the original disclosure `clearly allow[s] persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that [the inventor] invented what is <E T="03">claimed.</E>' ” <E T="03">Owens,</E> 710 F.3d at 1368 (quoting <E T="03">Ariad,</E> 598 F.3d at 1351) (alternations in original) (emphasis added).</P>

        <P>Issues of compliance with the written description requirement may arise where a later-claimed design is composed of only a subset of originally disclosed elements (the later-claimed design does not introduce any new elements that were not originally disclosed). In the vast majority of such situations, the fact that the subset of originally disclosed elements composing the later-claimed design is visible (claimed or unclaimed) in the original/earlier application is sufficient to demonstrate to the ordinary designer viewing the original/earlier application that the inventor had possession of the later-claimed design at the time of filing the original/earlier application. <E T="03">See Racing Strollers,</E> 878 F.2d at 1420 (stating “[a]s a practical matter, meeting the [written description] requirement of § 112 is, in the case of an ornamental design, simply a question of whether the earlier application contains illustrations, whatever form they may take, depicting the ornamental design illustrated in the later application and claimed therein . . . .”); <E T="03">see also</E>
          <E T="03">Daniels,</E> 144 F.3d at 1456 (stating “when an issue of priority arises under § 120 in the context of design patent prosecution, one looks to the drawings of the earlier application for disclosure of the subject matter claimed in the later application” and finding that “[t]he leecher as an article of manufacture is clearly visible in the earlier design application, demonstrating to the artisan viewing that application that [the inventor] had possession at that time of the later claimed design of that article [alone without the leaf ornamentation claimed in the earlier design application]”). In these situations, no further analysis by the examiner would be necessary with respect to the written description requirement.</P>

        <P>However, as mentioned earlier, limited situations may exist where a later-claimed design, composed of only a subset of originally disclosed elements (claimed or unclaimed), raises a question as to whether the later-claimed design is supported by the original/earlier disclosure, even though the elements composing the later-claimed design are visible in the original/earlier disclosure. An example of such limited situations is the situation in which there is an original disclosure composed of a grid of one hundred blocks (or a grid of several million pixels) and a later-claimed design composed of only a subset of interior blocks (or pixels) that form patterns (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a smiling face or a frowning face). In this situation, there is a question as to whether the later-claimed design is supported by the original disclosure, even though the interior blocks (or pixels) composing the patterns are visible in the original disclosure. <E T="03">See also,</E> “AIPLA Comments to USPTO on Written Description,” March 14, 2014, at page 3, available at <E T="03">http://www.uspto.gov/patents/law/comments/dr_a-aipla_20140314.pdf</E>, for a similar concept. In such limited situations, the examiner would determine whether an ordinary designer would recognize upon reviewing the complete original/earlier application that the inventor had possession of the later-claimed design in the original/<PRTPAGE P="22236"/>earlier disclosure. <E T="03">See Daniels,</E> 144 F.3d at 1456 (stating, “In general, precedent establishes that although the applicant `does not have to describe exactly the subject matter claimed, . . . the description must clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that [the applicant] invented what is claimed.' ”) (citations omitted). <E T="03">See also</E>
          <E T="03">Owens,</E> 710 F.3d at 1368 (quoting <E T="03">Ariad,</E> 598 F.3d at 1351).</P>

        <P>When making this determination, the examiner would consider what the original/earlier application, in its totality (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> including the title, any descriptive statements, and the drawings), would have reasonably conveyed to an ordinary designer at the time of the invention, and how an ordinary designer in the art would have designed the article that is the subject of the design claim. Such considerations can include the nature and intended use of the article embodying the claimed design as identified by the title or description (<E T="03">see, e.g.,</E> MPEP § 1503.01 I (9th ed. 2015)). If, based on these considerations, the examiner determines that an ordinary designer would not recognize upon reviewing the complete original/earlier application the later-claimed design in the original/earlier disclosure, the examiner would reject the claim for lack of written description (or in the case of a priority or benefit claim, the application would not be entitled to the earlier date).</P>
        <P>Since the Office has the initial burden of establishing a <E T="03">prima facie</E> case of lack of written description, should an examiner determine that a rejection is appropriate, the examiner must set forth express findings of fact which support the lack of written description determination (<E T="03">see</E> MPEP § 2163 for examination guidelines pertaining to the written description requirement). Upon reply by applicant, before rejecting the claim again under 35 U.S.C. 112(a) for lack of written description, the examiner would need to review the basis for the rejection in view of the record as a whole, including amendments, arguments, and any evidence submitted by applicant, such as affidavits or declarations.</P>

        <P>If the record as a whole demonstrates that the written description requirement is satisfied, the rejection would not be repeated in the next Office action. If, on the other hand, the record does not demonstrate that the written description is adequate to support the claim, the examiner again would reject the claim under 35 U.S.C. 112(a), fully respond to applicant's rebuttal arguments, and properly treat any further showings submitted by applicant in the reply. When rejecting the claim again for lack of written description, the examiner would need to thoroughly analyze and discuss any affidavits or declarations filed by applicant that are relevant to the 35 U.S.C. 112(a) written description requirement. <E T="03">See In re Alton,</E> 76 F.3d 1168, 1176 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Request for Public Comments</HD>

        <P>The USPTO is requesting written public comments on the USPTO's proposed approach for applying the written description requirement in design applications as discussed in this notice. Because the USPTO is considering providing examples after reviewing public comments on the proposed approach, the USPTO also is requesting specific examples that the public believes would be helpful to illustrate the proposed approach or any suggested approach for applying the written description requirement in design applications. In particular, the USPTO is seeking examples from the public that demonstrate adequate written description as well as examples that demonstrate a lack of written description. Additionally, examples of situations in which the presence or lack of written description is not readily apparent, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> examples that are close to the line between adequate written description and insufficient written description, would be most helpful. Once the USPTO has considered the comments and examples received, the USPTO will determine how best to proceed in view of the public feedback on the proposed approach for applying the written description requirement in design applications.</P>

          <P>Consistent with the Defense Health Agency's creation on October 1, 2013, the existing system of records, DHA 20 DoD, entitled “Department of Defense Suicide Event Report (DoDSER) System,” is being realigned to the Defense Health Agency's compilation of Privacy Act System of Records Notices (SORNs). The realignment of this system requires a change in its system identifier to reflect the numbering system used by the Defense Health Agency.</P>
          <P>The Defense Health Agency also proposes to alter this system of records. This system establishes, collects, and maintains integrated DoD enterprise and survey data to be used for direct reporting of Reportable Events involving individuals on active duty or serving in the Reserves, supporting ongoing population-based health surveillance activities and public health within DoD, and for analysis. Surveillance activities include the systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of outcome-specific data for use in planning and development of best practices, education, public health within DoD, and training on protocols for identifying, responding to, and managing individuals at increased risk of suicide; and implementation, evaluation, and prevention of suicide behaviors and Reportable Events within the DoD.</P>

In addition to renewing the expiration date, references to dates and award years dates have been updated on the forms and in the instructions for both documents. The FISAP form has been revised: (1) To use technology to gather existing data electronically from other sources requiring less data entry concerning Additional Institutions in Part I; (2) per discussions with OMB staff on 11/26/12 with concurrence on 11/30/12 to allow applicable aggregate level data entry concerning graduate and professional students for schools with non-traditional academic calendars; and (3) per OMB staff request <PRTPAGE P="22246"/>and discussions on 8/21/12 with concurrence on 8/24/12, to expand the income grid in the Part VI summary to collect a more concise breakdown of student data at the aggregate level.</P>

          <E T="03">Abstract:</E> The International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) is a computer-based international assessment of eighth-grade students' computer and information literacy (CIL) skills that will provide a comparison of U.S. student performance and technology access and use with those of the international peers. ICILS collects data on eighth-grade students' abilities to collect, manage, evaluate, and share digital information; their understanding of issues related to the safe and responsible use of electronic information; on student access to, use of, and engagement with ICT at school and at home; school environments for teaching and learning CIL; and teacher practices and experiences with ICT. The data collected through ICILS will also provide information about the nature and extent of the possible “digital divide” and has the potential to inform understanding of the relationship between technology skills and experience and student performance in other core subject areas. ICILS is conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), an international collective of research organizations and government agencies that create the assessment framework, assessment, and background questionnaires. In the U.S., the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) conducts this study. In preparation for the ICILS 2018 main study, NCES will conduct a field test from March through May 2017 to evaluate new assessment items and background questions, to ensure practices that promote low exclusion rates, and to ensure that classroom and student sampling procedures proposed for the main study are successful. The U.S. ICILS main study will be conducted in the spring of 2018. Field recruitment will begin in October 2016 and main study recruitment in May of 2017. This request is for the 2017 field test and the 2018 main study recruitment activities and the 2017 field test data collection.</P>

        <P>In a petition received July 21, 2015, Superior requested that the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) grant a waiver to certain models of larger commercial package boilers that cannot be tested under the existing DOE test procedure. The models of commercial packaged boilers at issue are models with higher input capacities that typically require higher steam pressure and alternative instrumentation due to the large quantities of fluids being measured.</P>

        <P>Title III, Part C of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 6311 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), established the Energy Conservation Program for certain industrial equipment, which includes commercial packaged boilers.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/> Part C specifically includes definitions (42 U.S.C. 6311), energy conservation standards (42 U.S.C 6313), test procedures (42 U.S.C. 6314), labeling provisions (42 U.S.C. 6315), and the authority to require information and reports from manufacturers (42 U.S.C. 6316). Part C authorizes the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to prescribe test procedures that are reasonably designed to produce results that measure energy efficiency, energy use, and estimated annual operating costs, and that are not unduly burdensome to conduct. (42 U.S.C. 6314(a)(2)) With respect to commercial packaged boilers, Part C requires DOE to use industry test procedures developed or recognized by the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) or the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), as referenced in ASHRAE/IES <SU>2</SU>

          <FTREF/> Standard 90.1, “Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings.” (42 U.S.C. 6314(a)(4)(A)) Further, if such an industry test procedure is amended, DOE is required to amend its test procedure to be consistent with the amended industry test procedure, unless it determines, by rule published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and supported by clear and convincing evidence, that the amended test procedure would be unduly burdensome to conduct or would not produce test results that reflect the energy efficiency, energy use, and estimated operating costs of that equipment during a representative average use cycle.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Petition for Waiver of Test Procedure</HD>
        <P>On July 21, 2015, Superior submitted a petition for waiver from the DOE test procedure for certain basic models of its commercial packaged boilers. The DOE test procedure for commercial packaged boilers is set forth at 10 CFR 431.86 and incorporates by reference Hydronics Institute (HI) BTS-2000, “Method to Determine Efficiency of Commercial Space Heating Boilers” (BTS-2000).</P>
        <P>According to Superior, there are several issues that make BTS-2000 incompatible with larger commercial packaged boilers, including those identified in its petition for waiver. Superior stated that the requirements to use test conditions specified in BTS-2000 and the instrumentation requirements are outdated. Specifically, Superior indicated the following regarding the test conditions:</P>
        <P>• The 0 to 2 psig test pressure for steam boilers may be adequate for residential and small commercial (cast iron) boilers sized [commercial packaged] boilers, however such steam pressures are not compatible with large [commercial packaged] boilers as it will cause water carryover in large quantities, and an inability to meet design water flow rates and firing rates;</P>
        <P>• Typically test steam pressures in the range of 10 to 12 psig are required; and</P>

        <P>• Test temperatures defined for hot water [commercial packaged] boilers cause thermal shock problems in large [commercial packaged] boilers.<PRTPAGE P="22251"/>
        </P>
        <P>Superior also indicated the following regarding the instrumentation chart in Table 1 of section 6.0, “Instruments,” of BTS-2000:</P>
        <P>• Steam pressure cannot be measured by mercury manometer as the use of mercury in instruments and controls is banned; the correct instrument is a Bourdon Tube Gauge for pressures of 0 to 30 psig;</P>
        <P>• Large boilers typically fire into a positive pressure combustion chamber, thus gas pressure, firebox pressure and vent/flue pressure instruments all need to reflect this;</P>
        <P>• The use of scales to measure water/condensate/moisture flow rates is incompatible with the volume of these fluids being used or generated by large [commercial packaged] boilers;</P>
        <P>• Water flow meters should be used and in the case of moisture content, current practice is to use a throttling calorimeter;</P>
        <P>• The measurement of carbon dioxide as a means of calculating excess air or oxygen is considered obsolete in the large [commercial packaged] boiler industry; direct measurement of excess oxygen is the preferred method as modern oxygen meters can easily be calibrated against the oxygen in the ambient air;</P>
        <P>• Carbon Monoxide levels are no longer measured as a percentage; the current preferred unit is parts per million (ppm).</P>
        <P>To address these concerns, Superior proposes to use the newly published American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) 1500-2015, “Standard for Performance Rating of Commercial Space Heating Boilers” (ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015) in place of BTS-2000. AHRI developed ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 as a replacement for BTS-2000 in order to make the test procedure suitable for use with larger commercial packaged boilers, as well as improve and clarify the test method. Superior claims that use of this ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 is necessary as it is compatible with the size of commercial packaged boilers they manufacture.</P>
        <P>Additionally, for the large commercial packaged boilers capable of supplying either steam or hot water identified in this petition, Superior requests that, when determining the combustion efficiency in hot water mode based on testing in steam mode only, the combustion efficiency rating be determined based on an adjusted combustion efficiency. Superior requests that an adjustment be made to the measured stack temperature to be used in calculating combustion efficiency based on the relative difference between the flue gas temperature and the bulk fluid temperature when operating in steam mode as opposed to hot water using the following relationship:</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">T<E T="52">stack, hw</E> = (T<E T="52">stack, steam</E> − T<E T="52">sat</E>) + T<E T="52">bulk, hw</E>
        </FP>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP>where T<E T="52">stack, hw</E> is the stack temperature to be used to determine the combustion efficiency in hot water mode, T<E T="52">stack, steam</E> is the measured stack temperature when testing on steam, T<E T="52">sat</E> is the saturation temperature of steam at the test pressure, and T<E T="52">bulk</E> is the temperature of the outlet water when testing in hot water mode and is equal to 180 °F. According to Superior, using this adjusted stack temperature to calculate combustion efficiency is a more accurate representation of the actual efficiency when operating as a hot water commercial packaged boiler than simply using combustion efficiency value for steam mode.</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>The following basic models are included in Superior's petition: Arrowhead, Triad, Apache, Seminole, Super Seminole, Mohican, Aztec, Mohawk, Osage, SX-6, and SX-8.</P>
        <P>DOE notes that it has published a notice of proposed rulemaking (March 2016 CPB TP NOPR) to amend its test procedure for commercial packaged boilers prescribed in 10 CFR part 431 subpart E. 81 FR 14641 (Mar. 17, 2016). The proposed amended test procedure addresses, among other changes, the issues raised in this waiver request by incorporating by reference ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 as a replacement for BTS-2000 in the DOE test procedure for commercial packaged boilers. In addition to adopting ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 as a replacement for BTS-2000, DOE further proposes several modifications to its test procedure that are not captured in ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 in order to improve repeatability, add clarification, and accommodate testing of some equipment that has experienced difficulty in testing to the existing DOE test procedure. Among these changes, DOE proposes to adopt the stack temperature adjustment described by Superior when using the tested combustion efficiency of large steam commercial packaged boilers to represent the combustion efficiency of large commercial packaged boilers in hot water mode.</P>

        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Attention: Ms. Ashley Armstrong</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Subject: Revised Commercial Packaged Boilers Waiver Request</FP>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Dear Ms. Armstrong,</FP>
        

        <P>We previously submitted a waiver request on June 30, 2015 but wish to submit this revised waiver request in place of it. In accordance with the provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 431, paragraph 431.401, Superior Boiler Works, Inc. is hereby petitioning for a waiver from the following specific test procedures <PRTPAGE P="22252"/>specified for Commercial Packaged Boilers:</P>
        <P>1. Paragraph 431.86 Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency of commercial packaged boilers. This section requirements that boilers be tested using the provisions of HI BTS-2000. We propose to use the newly published AHRI Standard 1500, 2015 Standard for Performance Rating of Commercial Space Heating Boilers. There are several issues that make BTS 2000 incompatible with larger boilers that were previously identified and discussed. AHRI has worked diligently over the last year or so to revise BTS-2000 in order to address those issues and make BTS 2000 suitable for larger boilers. AHRI Standard 1500 is the result of that work. Use of this new standard is desirable as it is compatible with the various size boilers we manufacture.</P>
        <P>2. Paragraph 431.86(c)(1)(iv) The requirement to use test conditions specified in BTS-2000 specifically the requirements for the test pressure for steam boilers, the required water temperatures for hot water boilers and instrumentation requirements seem to refer back to the middle of the last century rather than the present day, for example:</P>
        <P>• The 0 to 2 psig test pressure for steam boilers may be perfectly adequate for residential and small commercial (cast iron) boilers sized boilers, however is not compatible with large boilers as it will cause water carryover in large quantities, and an inability to meet design water flow rates and firing rates. Typically test pressures in range 10 to 12 psig are required.</P>
        <P>• Test temperatures defined for hot water boilers are guaranteed to cause thermal shock problems in large boilers.</P>
        <P>• The instrumentation chart, Table 1, has several problem areas, as follows:</P>
        <P>○ Steam pressure cannot be measured by mercury manometer as the use of mercury in instruments and controls is banned. The correct instrument is a Bourdon Tube Gauge 0 to 30 psig</P>
        <P>○ Large boilers typically fire into a positive pressure combustion chamber, thus gas pressure, firebox pressure and vent/flue pressure instruments all need to reflect this.</P>
        <P>○ The use of scales to measure water/condensate/moisture flow rates is incompatible with the sheer volume of these fluids being used or generated by large boilers. Water flow meters should be used and in the case of moisture content, current practice is to use a throttling calorimeter.</P>
        <P>○ The measurement of carbon dioxide as a means of calculating excess air or oxygen is considered obsolete in the large boiler industry. Direct measurement of excess oxygen is the preferred method as modern oxygen meters can easily be calibrated against the oxygen in the ambient air.</P>
        <P>○ Carbon Monoxide levels are no longer measured as a percentage. The current preferred unit is ppm.</P>
        
        <FP>AHRI 1500 has taken into account these changes.</FP>
        
        <P>3. Paragraph 431.86(c)(2)(iii)(B) Rating. This paragraph specifies that for boilers capable of supplying either steam or hot water, that are tested on steam only, the hot water efficiency shall be based on the testing in the steam mode. We propose to use an adjusted steam efficiency for hot water when testing on steam only. The adjustment is made to the measured stack temperature to be used in calculating efficiency based on the relative difference between the flue gas temperature and the bulk fluid temperature when operating on steam vs. hot water using the following relationship:</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Tstack<E T="52">hw</E> = (Tstack<E T="52">steam</E> − T<E T="52">sat</E>) + Tbulk<E T="52">hw</E>, where</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Tstack<E T="52">hw</E> = stack temperature to be used to determine the efficiency on hot water.</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Tstack<E T="52">steam</E> = measured stack temperature when testing on steam.</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Tbulk<E T="52">hw</E> = 180 °F</FP>
        
        <P>The dominant heat transfer variable for both steam and hot water boilers is the gas side coefficient and there is very little difference in the overall heat transfer coefficient between steam and hot water boilers. It is possible therefore to determine what a hot water boiler stack temperature will be based on a steam test based on the difference in the bulk fluid temperature in the boiler. We believe that using this adjusted stack temperature to calculate efficiency is a more accurate representation of the actual efficiency when operating as a hot water boiler than simply using the steam efficiency value.</P>
        <P>The basic models that this request is applicable to are scotch marine, firetube boilers used for commercial packaged space heating, Section IV ASME applications. The specific models offered by Superior Boiler Works in this category for section IV ASME applications includes the following:</P>
        <P>1. Arrowhead</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Petition for Waiver of Test Procedure</HD>
        <P>On July 24, 2015, Cleaver-Brooks submitted a petition for waiver from the DOE test procedure for certain basic models of its commercial packaged boilers. The DOE test procedure for commercial packaged boilers is set forth at 10 CFR 431.86 and incorporates by reference Hydronics Institute (HI) BTS-2000, “Method to Determine Efficiency of Commercial Space Heating Boilers” (BTS-2000).</P>
        <P>According to Cleaver-Brooks, there are several issues that make BTS-2000 incompatible with larger commercial packaged boilers, including those identified in its petition for waiver. Cleaver-Brooks stated that the requirements to use test conditions specified in BTS-2000 and the instrumentation requirements are outdated. Specifically, Cleaver-Brooks indicated the following regarding the test conditions:</P>
        <P>• The 0 to 2 psig test pressure for steam boilers may be adequate for residential and small commercial (cast iron) boilers sized [commercial packaged] boilers, however such steam pressures are not compatible with large [commercial packaged] boilers as it will cause water carryover in large quantities, and an inability to meet design water flow rates and firing rates;</P>
        <P>• Typically test steam pressures in the range of 10 to 12 psig are required; and</P>
        <P>• Test temperatures defined for hot water [commercial packaged] boilers cause thermal shock problems in large [commercial packaged] boilers.</P>
        <P>Cleaver-Brooks also indicated the following regarding the instrumentation chart in Table 1 of section 6.0, “Instruments,” of BTS-2000:</P>

        <P>• Steam pressure cannot be measured by mercury manometer as the use of <PRTPAGE P="22254"/>mercury in instruments and controls is banned; the correct instrument is a Bourdon Tube Gauge for pressures of 0 to 30 psig;</P>
        <P>• Large boilers typically fire into a positive pressure combustion chamber, thus gas pressure, firebox pressure and vent/flue pressure instruments all need to reflect this;</P>
        <P>• The use of scales to measure water/condensate/moisture flow rates is incompatible with the volume of these fluids being used or generated by large [commercial packaged] boilers;</P>
        <P>• Water flow meters should be used and in the case of moisture content, current practice is to use a throttling calorimeter;</P>
        <P>• The measurement of carbon dioxide as a means of calculating excess air or oxygen is considered obsolete in the large [commercial packaged] boiler industry; direct measurement of excess oxygen is the preferred method as modern oxygen meters can easily be calibrated against the oxygen in the ambient air;</P>
        <P>• Carbon Monoxide levels are no longer measured as a percentage; the current preferred unit is parts per million (ppm).</P>
        <P>To address these concerns, Cleaver-Brooks proposes to use the newly published American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) 1500-2015, “Standard for Performance Rating of Commercial Space Heating Boilers” (ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015) in place of BTS-2000. AHRI developed ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 as a replacement for BTS-2000 in order to make the test procedure suitable for use with larger commercial packaged boilers, as well as improve and clarify the test method. Cleaver-Brooks claims that use of this ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 is necessary as it is compatible with the size of commercial packaged boilers they manufacture.</P>
        <P>Additionally, for the large commercial packaged boilers capable of supplying either steam or hot water identified in this petition, Cleaver-Brooks requests that, when determining the combustion efficiency in hot water mode based on testing in steam mode only, the combustion efficiency rating be determined based on an adjusted combustion efficiency. Cleaver-Brooks requests that an adjustment be made to the measured stack temperature to be used in calculating combustion efficiency based on the relative difference between the flue gas temperature and the bulk fluid temperature when operating in steam mode as opposed to hot water using the following relationship:</P>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2"> T<E T="52">stack, hw</E> = (T<E T="52">stack, steam</E> − T<E T="52">sat</E>) + T<E T="52">bulk, hw</E>
        </FP>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <FP SOURCE="FP-2">where T<E T="52">stack, hw</E> is the stack temperature to be used to determine the combustion efficiency in hot water mode, T<E T="52">stack, steam</E> is the measured stack temperature when testing on steam, T<E T="52">sat</E> is the saturation temperature of steam at the test pressure, and T<E T="52">bulk, hw</E> is the temperature of the outlet water when testing in hot water mode and is equal to 180 °F. According to Cleaver-Brooks, using this adjusted stack temperature to calculate combustion efficiency is a more accurate representation of the actual efficiency when operating as a hot water commercial packaged boiler than simply using combustion efficiency value for steam mode.</FP>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>The following basic models are included in Cleaver-Brooks' petition: CBEX-E, CBEX-P, 4WI/4WG, CBLE, CBR, CBL, CB, CFC, CFLC, CFW, CFH, FLX and M5.</P>
        <P>DOE notes that it has published a notice of proposed rulemaking (March 2016 CPB TP NOPR) to amend its test procedure for commercial packaged boilers prescribed in 10 CFR part 431 subpart E. 81 FR 14641 (Mar. 17, 2016). The proposed amended test procedure addresses, among other changes, the issues raised in this waiver request by incorporating by reference ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 as a replacement for BTS-2000 in the DOE test procedure for commercial packaged boilers. In addition to adopting ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 as a replacement for BTS-2000, DOE further proposes several modifications to its test procedure that are not captured in ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 in order to improve repeatability, add clarification, and accommodate testing of some equipment that has experienced difficulty in testing to the existing DOE test procedure. Among these changes, DOE proposes to adopt the stack temperature adjustment described by Cleaver-Brooks when using the tested combustion efficiency of large steam commercial packaged boilers to represent the combustion efficiency of large commercial packaged boilers in hot water mode.</P>

        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Subject: RE: Test Procedure Waiver</FP>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 431, paragraph 431.401, Cleaver-Brooks is hereby petitioning for a waiver from the following test procedures specified for Commercial Packaged Boilers:</P>

        <P>1. Paragraph 431.86 Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency of commercial packaged boilers. This section requires the boilers be tested using the provisions of HI BTS-2000. We propose to use the newly published AHRI 1500, 2015 Standard for Performance Rating of Commercial Space Heating Boilers. There are several issues that make BTS 2000 incompatible with the larger boilers that were identified in previous waiver requests. AHRI has worked diligently over the past year to revise BTS-2000 in order to address those issues and make BTS-<PRTPAGE P="22255"/>2000 suitable for use with larger boilers. AHRI Standard 1500 is the result of that work. Use of this new standard is required as it is compatible with the size boilers we manufacture.</P>
        <P>2. Paragraph 431.86(c)(1)(iv) The requirement to use test conditions specified in BTS-2000 specifically the requirements for the test pressure for steam boilers, the required water temperatures for hot water boilers and instrumentation requirements seem to refer back to the middle of the last century rather than the present day, for example:</P>
        <P>• The 0 to 2 psig test pressure for steam boilers may be perfectly adequate for residential and small commercial (cast iron) boilers sized boilers, however is not compatible with large boilers as it will cause water carryover in large quantities, and an inability to meet design water flow rates and firing rates. Typically test pressures in range 10 to 12 psig are required.</P>
        <P>• Test temperatures defined for hot water boilers are guaranteed to cause thermal shock problems in large boilers.</P>
        <P>• The instrumentation chart, Table 1, has several problem areas, as follows:</P>
        <P>○ Steam pressure cannot be measured by mercury manometer as the use of mercury in instruments and controls is banned. The correct instrument is a Bourdon Tube Gauge 0 to 30 psig</P>
        <P>○ Large boilers typically fire into a positive pressure combustion chamber, thus gas pressure, firebox pressure and vent/flue pressure instruments all need to reflect this.</P>
        <P>○ The use of scales to measure water/condensate/moisture flow rates is incompatible with the sheer volume of these fluids being used or generated by large boilers. Water flow meters should be used and in the case of moisture content, current practice is to use a throttling calorimeter.</P>
        <P>○ The measurement of carbon dioxide as a means of calculating excess air or oxygen is considered obsolete in the large boiler industry. Direct measurement of excess oxygen is the preferred method as modern oxygen meters can easily be calibrated against the oxygen in the ambient air.</P>
        <P>○ Carbon Monoxide levels are no longer measured as a percentage. The current preferred unit is ppm.</P>
        <FP>AHRI 1500 has taken into account these changes.</FP>
        <P>3. Paragraph 431.86(c)(2)(iii)(B) Rating. This paragraph specifies that for boilers capable of supplying either steam or hot water, that they are tested on steam only, the hot water efficiency shall be based on the testing in the steam mode. We propose to use an adjusted steam efficiency for hot water when testing on steam only. The adjustment is made to the measured stack temperature to be used in calculating efficiency based on the relative difference between the flue gas temperature and the bulk fluid temperature when operating on steam v hot water using the following relationship:</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Tstack<E T="52">hw</E> = (Tstack<E T="52">steam</E>−T<E T="52">sat</E>) + Tbulk<E T="52">hw</E>
        </FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Where:</FP>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Tstack<E T="52">hw</E> = Stack temperature to be used to determine the efficiency on hot water</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Tstack<E T="52">steam</E> = Measured stack temperature when testing on steam</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">T<E T="52">sat</E> = Saturation temperature of steam at the test pressure</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-2">Tbulk<E T="52">hw</E> = 180 °F</FP>
        
        <P>The dominant heat transfer variable for both steam and hot water boilers is the gas side coefficient and there is very little difference in the overall heat transfer coefficient between steam and hot water boilers. It is possible therefore to determine what a hot water boiler stack temperature will be, based on a steam test and the bulk fluid temperature difference within the boiler. We believe that using this adjusted stack temperature to calculate efficiency is a more accurate representation of the actual efficiency when operating as a hot water boiler than simply using the steam efficiency value.</P>
        <P>The basic models that this request is applicable to are as follows: CBEX-E, CBEX-P, 4WI/4WG, CBLE, CBR, CBL, CB, CFC, CFLC, CFW, CFH, FLX and M5.</P>
        <P>Other known Manufacturers of similar products are listed below. These manufacturers will be notified by Cleaver-Brooks of this waiver, if and when the deviation is granted, in accordance with paragraph 431.401(c).</P>

        <P>On July 21, 2015, York-Shipley submitted a petition for waiver from the DOE test procedure for certain basic models of its commercial packaged boilers. The DOE test procedure for commercial packaged boilers is set forth at 10 CFR 431.86 and incorporates by reference Hydronics Institute (HI) BTS-2000, “Method to Determine Efficiency of Commercial Space Heating Boilers” (BTS-2000).</P>
        <P>According to York-Shipley, there are several issues that make BTS-2000 incompatible with larger commercial packaged boilers, including those identified in its petition for waiver. York-Shipley stated that the requirements to use test conditions specified in BTS-2000 and the instrumentation requirements are outdated. Specifically, York-Shipley indicated the following regarding the test conditions:</P>
        <P>• The 0 to 2 psig test pressure for steam boilers may be adequate for residential and small commercial (cast iron) boilers sized [commercial packaged] boilers, however such steam pressures are not compatible with large [commercial packaged] boilers as it will cause water carryover in large quantities, and an inability to meet design water flow rates and firing rates;</P>
        <P>• Typically test steam pressures in the range of 10 to 12 psig are required; and</P>
        <P>• Test temperatures defined for hot water [commercial packaged] boilers cause thermal shock problems in large [commercial packaged] boilers.</P>
        <P>York-Shipley also indicated the following regarding the instrumentation chart in Table 1 of section 6.0, “Instruments,” of BTS-2000:</P>
        <P>• Steam pressure cannot be measured by mercury manometer as the use of mercury in instruments and controls is banned; the correct instrument is a Bourdon Tube Gauge for pressures of 0 to 30 psig;</P>
        <P>• Large boilers typically fire into a positive pressure combustion chamber, thus gas pressure, firebox pressure and vent/flue pressure instruments all need to reflect this;</P>
        <P>• The use of scales to measure water/condensate/moisture flow rates is incompatible with the volume of these fluids being used or generated by large [commercial packaged] boilers;</P>
        <P>• Water flow meters should be used and in the case of moisture content, current practice is to use a throttling calorimeter;</P>
        <P>• The measurement of carbon dioxide as a means of calculating excess air or oxygen is considered obsolete in the large [commercial packaged] boiler industry; direct measurement of excess oxygen is the preferred method as modern oxygen meters can easily be calibrated against the oxygen in the ambient air;</P>

        <P>• Carbon Monoxide levels are no longer measured as a percentage; the current preferred unit is parts per million (ppm).<PRTPAGE P="22257"/>
        </P>
        <P>To address these concerns, York-Shipley proposes to use the newly published American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) 1500-2015, “Standard for Performance Rating of Commercial Space Heating Boilers” (ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015) in place of BTS-2000. AHRI developed ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 as a replacement for BTS-2000 in order to make the test procedure suitable for use with larger commercial packaged boilers, as well as improve and clarify the test method. York-Shipley claims that use of this ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 is necessary as it is compatible with the size of commercial packaged boilers they manufacture.</P>
        <P>Additionally, for the large commercial packaged boilers capable of supplying either steam or hot water identified in this petition, York-Shipley requests that, when determining the combustion efficiency in hot water mode based on testing in steam mode only, the combustion efficiency rating be determined based on an adjusted combustion efficiency. York-Shipley requests that an adjustment be made to the measured stack temperature to be used in calculating combustion efficiency based on the relative difference between the flue gas temperature and the bulk fluid temperature when operating in steam mode as opposed to hot water using the following relationship:</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">T<E T="52">stack, hw</E> = (T<E T="52">stack, steam</E> − T<E T="52">sat</E>) + T<E T="52">bulk, hw</E>
        </FP>
        
        <FP>where T<E T="52">stack, hw</E> is the stack temperature to be used to determine the combustion efficiency in hot water mode, T<E T="52">stack, steam</E> is the measured stack temperature when testing on steam, T<E T="52">sat</E> is the saturation temperature of steam at the test pressure, and T<E T="52">bulk, hw</E> is the temperature of the outlet water when testing in hot water mode and is equal to 180 °F. According to York-Shipley, using this adjusted stack temperature to calculate combustion efficiency is a more accurate representation of the actual efficiency when operating as a hot water commercial packaged boiler than simply using combustion efficiency value for steam mode.</FP>
        <P>The following basic models are included in York-Shipley's petition:</P>

        <P>DOE notes that it has published a notice of proposed rulemaking (March 2016 CPB TP NOPR) to amend its test procedure for commercial packaged boilers prescribed in 10 CFR part 431 subpart E. 81 FR 14641 (Mar. 17, 2016). The proposed amended test procedure addresses, among other changes, the issues raised in this waiver request by incorporating by reference ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 as a replacement for BTS-2000 in the DOE test procedure for commercial packaged boilers. In addition to adopting ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 as a replacement for BTS-2000, DOE further proposes several modifications to its test procedure that are not captured in ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 in order to improve repeatability, add clarification, and accommodate testing of some equipment that has experienced difficulty in testing to the existing DOE test procedure. Among these changes, DOE proposes to adopt the stack temperature adjustment described by York-Shipley when using the tested combustion efficiency of large steam commercial packaged boilers to represent the combustion efficiency of large commercial packaged boilers in hot water mode.</P>

        <FP SOURCE="FP1-2">Efficiency Rating of Commercial Packaged Space Heating Boilers</FP>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Dear Ms. Armstrong,</FP>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 431, paragraph 431.401, York-Shipley Global—Division of AESYS Technologies, LLC is hereby petitioning for a waiver from the following test procedures specified for Commercial Packaged Space Heating Boilers:</P>
        <P>A. Paragraph 431.86 Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency of commercial packaged boilers. This section requires the boilers be tested using the provisions of HI BTS-2000. We propose to use the newly published ANSI/AHRI 1500-2015, 2015 Standard for Performance Rating of Commercial Space Heating Boilers. There are several issues that make BTS 2000 incompatible with the larger boilers that were identified in previous waiver requests. AHRI has worked diligently over the past year to revise BTS-2000 in order to address those issues and make BTS-2000 suitable for use with larger boilers. ANSI/AHRI Standard 1500-2015 is the result of that work. Use of this new standard is required as it is compatible with the size boilers we manufacture.</P>

        <P>B. Paragraph 431.86(c)(1)(iv) The requirement to use test conditions specified in BTS-2000 specifically the requirements for the test pressure for steam boilers, the required water temperatures for hot water boilers and instrumentation requirements seem to <PRTPAGE P="22258"/>refer back to the middle of the last century rather than the present day, for example:</P>
        <P>1. The 0 to 2 psig test pressure for steam boilers may be perfectly adequate for residential and small commercial (cast iron) boilers sized boilers, however is not compatible with large boilers as it will cause water carryover in large quantities, and an inability to meet design water flow rates and firing rates. Typically test pressures in range 10 to 12 psig are required.</P>
        <P>2. Test temperatures defined for hot water boilers are guaranteed to cause thermal shock problems in large boilers.</P>
        <P>3. The instrumentation chart, Table 1, has several problem areas, as follows:</P>
        <P>a. Steam pressure cannot be measured by mercury manometer as the use of mercury in instruments and controls is banned. The correct instrument is a Bourdon Tube Gauge 0 to 30 psig</P>
        <P>b. Large boilers typically fire into a positive pressure combustion chamber, thus gas pressure, firebox pressure and vent/flue pressure instruments all need to reflect this.</P>
        <P>c. The use of scales to measure water/condensate/moisture flow rates is incompatible with the sheer volume of these fluids being used or generated by large boilers. Water flow meters should be used and in the case of moisture content, current practice is to use a throttling calorimeter.</P>
        <P>d. The measurement of carbon dioxide as a means of calculating excess air or oxygen is considered obsolete in the large boiler industry. Direct measurement of excess oxygen is the preferred method as modern oxygen meters can easily be calibrated against the oxygen in the ambient air.</P>
        <P>e. Carbon Monoxide levels are no longer measured as a percentage. The current preferred unit is ppm.</P>
        <P>ANSI/AHRI 1500-2015 has taken into account these changes.</P>
        <P>C. Paragraph 431.86(c)(2)(iii)(B) Rating. This paragraph specifies that for boilers capable of supplying either steam or hot water, that they are tested on steam only, the hot water efficiency shall be based on the testing in the steam mode. We propose to use an adjusted steam efficiency for hot water when testing on steam only. The adjustment is made to the measured stack temperature to be used in calculating efficiency based on the relative difference between the flue gas temperature and the bulk fluid temperature, when operating on steam versus hot water, using the following relationship:</P>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Tstackhw = (Tstacksteam−Tsat) + Tbulkhw</FP>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Where:</FP>
        
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Tstackhw = Stack temperature to be used to determine the efficiency on hot water</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Tstacksteam = Measured stack temperature when testing on steam</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Tsat = Saturation temperature of steam at the test pressure</FP>
        <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Tbulkhw = 180 °F</FP>
        
        <P>The dominant heat transfer variable for both steam and hot water boilers is the gas side coefficient and there is very little difference in the overall heat transfer coefficient between steam and hot water boilers. It is possible therefore to determine what a hot water boiler stack temperature will be, based on a steam test and the bulk fluid temperature difference within the boiler. We believe that using this adjusted stack temperature to calculate efficiency is a more accurate representation of the actual efficiency when operating as a hot water boiler than simply using the steam efficiency value.</P>

        <SUBJECT>Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC; Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review of the SM-80 MAOP Restoration Project</SUBJECT>
        <P>On September 2, 2015, Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC (Columbia) filed an application in Docket No. CP15-549-000 requesting a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity pursuant to Sections 7(c) and 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act to abandon, construct, and operate certain natural gas pipeline facilities in Wayne County, West Virginia. The proposed project is known as the SM-80 MAOP Restoration Project (Project) and would restore the maximum allowable operating pressure of part of the SM-80 system.</P>
        <P>On September 15, 2015, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission or FERC) issued its Notice of Application for the Project. Among other things, that notice alerted agencies issuing federal authorizations of the requirement to complete all necessary reviews and to reach a final decision on a request for a federal authorization within 90 days of the date of issuance of the Commission staff's Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Project. This instant notice identifies the FERC staff's planned schedule for the completion of the EA for the Project.</P>

        <P>If a schedule change becomes necessary, additional notice will be provided so that the relevant agencies are kept informed of the Project's progress.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Project Description</HD>
        <P>Columbia proposes to abandon in place about 3.3 miles of 30-inch-diameter pipeline and associated aboveground appurtenances located on its existing SM-80 natural gas transmission system located in Wayne County, West Virginia. This section would be abandoned due to its age and condition. Columbia would also construct about 3.9 miles of 30-inch-diameter pipeline to replace the abandoned pipeline. The new pipeline would be co-located with the existing SM-80 Loop <SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/> and other existing easements for 3.8 of the 3.9 miles.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>On October 15, 2015, the Commission issued a <E T="03">Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed SM-80 MAOP Restoration Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues</E> (NOI). The NOI was sent to affected landowners; federal, state, and local government agencies; elected officials; environmental and public interest groups; Native American tribes; other interested parties; and local libraries and newspapers. In response to the NOI, the Commission received comments from two landowners. The primary issues raised by the commentors are the potential for soil and water contamination, impacts on wildlife, air, and noise, and cumulative impacts.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Additional Information</HD>

        <P>In order to receive notification of the issuance of the EA and to keep track of all formal issuances and submittals in specific dockets, the Commission offers a free service called eSubscription.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. What information is EPA particularly interested in?</HD>
        <P>Pursuant to PRA section 3506(c)(2)(A) (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)), EPA specifically solicits comments and information to enable it to:</P>
        <P>1. Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Agency, including whether the information will have practical utility.</P>
        <P>2. Evaluate the accuracy of the Agency's estimates of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used.</P>
        <P>3. Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected.</P>

        <P>4. Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> permitting electronic submission of responses. In particular, EPA is requesting comments from very small businesses (those that employ less than 25) on examples of specific additional efforts that EPA could make to reduce the paperwork burden for very small businesses affected by this collection.</P>

An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to <PRTPAGE P="22262"/>respond to, a collection of information, unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The OMB control numbers for EPA's regulations in title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), after appearing in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> when approved, are listed in 40 CFR part 9, are displayed either by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or by other appropriate means, such as on the related collection instrument or form, if applicable.

        <P>
          <E T="03">Abstract:</E> The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (Customs) regulations at 19 CFR 12.112 require that an importer desiring to import a pesticide or device into the United States shall, prior to the shipment's arrival in the United States, submit a Notice of Arrival (NOA) of Pesticides and Devices (EPA Form 3540-1) to EPA. Once EPA receives the NOA, EPA will determine the disposition of the shipment upon its arrival in the United States. Upon completing its review, the EPA response is sent to the importer of record or licensed customs broker, who must present the NOA to Customs upon arrival of the shipment at the port of entry. This is necessary to ensure that EPA is notified of the arrival of pesticides and pesticidal devices as required under FIFRA section 17(c), and that EPA has the ability to examine such shipments to determine compliance with FIFRA. Customs compares entry documents for the shipment with the NOA and notifies the EPA regional office of any discrepancies.</P>

          <E T="03">Burden statement:</E> The annual public reporting and recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 0.43 hours per response. Burden is defined in 5 CFR 1320.3(b).</P>
        <P>The ICR, which is available in the docket along with other related materials, provides a detailed explanation of the collection activities and the burden estimate that is only briefly summarized here:</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Respondents/affected entities:</E> Entities potentially affected by this ICR are pesticide importers, which includes many types of business entities ranging from Commercial and Institutional Building Construction (NAICS 236220) to Pesticide and Other Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing (NAICS 325300) and even Public Administration: Executive Offices (NAICS 921110). Other business and institutions that import pesticides include Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting (Sector 11), Wholesale Trade, (Sector 42). The majority of responses come from businesses that fall under NAICS code 325300.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated total number of potential respondents:</E> 38,000.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Frequency of response:</E> On occasion.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated total average number of responses for each respondent:</E> 1.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated total annual burden hours:</E> 16,340 hours.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Estimated total annual costs:</E> $1,006,034. This is the estimated burden cost; there is no cost for capital investment or maintenance and operational costs.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Are there changes in the estimates from the last approval?</HD>
        <P>There is an increase of 3,870 hours in the total estimated respondent burden compared with that identified in the ICR currently approved by OMB. This increase reflects EPA's updating of burden estimates for this collection based upon historical information on the number of NOAs received by EPA. Based upon revised estimates, the number of NOAs received has increased from 35,000 to 38,000. The average burden hours per response will remain unchanged from the previous ICR renewal of 0.43 hours per response. This change is an adjustment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. What is the next step in the process for this ICR?</HD>

        <P>EPA will consider the comments received and amend the ICR as appropriate. The final ICR package will then be submitted to OMB for review and approval pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.12. EPA will issue another <E T="04">Federal Register</E> document pursuant to 5 CFR 1320.5(a)(1)(iv) to announce the submission of the ICR to OMB and the opportunity to submit additional comments to OMB. If you have any questions about this ICR or the approval process, please contact the person listed under <E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>.</P>

        <P>The Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134) and the Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1998 (Pub. L. 105-65) authorize EPA to combine categorical grant funds appropriated in EPA's State and Tribal Assistance Grant (STAG) account and award the funds as PPGs. Public Law 104-134 states, in relevant part, that: “the Administrator is authorized to make grants annually from funds appropriated under this heading, subject to such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish, to any State or federally recognized Indian tribe for multimedia or single media pollution prevention, control and abatement and related environmental activities at the request of the Governor or other appropriate State official or the tribe.”</P>
        <P>Public Law 105-65 amended the PPG authority by authorizing “interstate agencies, tribal consortia, and air pollution control agencies” to receive PPGs. Pursuant to the authority granted in Public Law 104-134 and Public Law 105-65, EPA promulgated PPG regulations in January of 2001 as part of the Agency's revision of 40 CFR part 35, the rules governing categorical environmental program grants. The regulation at 40 CFR 35.133(b) states that: “The Administrator may, in guidance or regulation, describe subsequent additions, deletions, or changes to the list of environmental programs eligible for inclusion in Performance Partnership Grants.”</P>

        <P>EPA is authorized under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), Title II of Division G to award $21 million in multi-purpose grants to states and tribes for implementation of environmental <PRTPAGE P="22263"/>programs and projects that complement existing environmental program grants, including interagency agreements. The conference report's language clarifies that these funds will allow states and tribes to have the necessary flexibility to direct resources for the implementation of high priority activities, including the processing of permits, which complement programs under established environmental statutes.</P>

        <P>The multi-purpose categorical grant program is funded under EPA's STAG appropriations account and, therefore, is eligible for inclusion in PPGs. This notice is made pursuant to 40 CFR 35.133(b), to inform entities eligible to receive PPGs that the program listed above may be included in a PPG subject to any limitations herein defined. Hereafter, multi-purpose grants are eligible for inclusion in PPGs and may be included in a PPG at the request of the appropriate official of an eligible entity, subject to EPA's regulations at 2 CFR part 200 and 2 CFR part 1500 and 40 CFR 35.001-35.138 and 35.500-35.538. The authority to issue this <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice has been delegated to the Deputy Associate Administrator for Intergovernmental Relations.</P>

          <P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 5 is announcing a change to its procedures for issuing public notices seeking comment when the Region proposes to list impaired waters after disapproving or partially disapproving a state's list of impaired waters (303(d) list) under Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 303(d), or the Region proposes to establish a total maximum daily load (TMDL) under CWA Section 303(d). For any future proposed action to include waters on a state's 303(d) list or establish a TMDL, EPA Region 5 will provide public notice on the 303(d)/TMDL Program Web page (<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/tmdl/impaired-waters-and-tmdls-region-5</E>) rather than by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

        <P>This notice announces a change in procedures by which EPA Region 5 issues public notices seeking comment under 40 CFR 130.7(d)(2) for its proposed listing of impaired waters where the Region disapproves a state's 303(d) list, or proposes to establish TMDLs.</P>

        <P>Under Section 303(d)(1)(A) of the CWA, each state is required to identify and prioritize the waters within its boundaries for which technology-based effluent limitations and other required controls are not stringent enough to achieve the applicable water quality standards. <E T="03">See also</E> 40 CFR 130.7(b)(1). Each state must submit biennially a 303(d) list to the EPA Regional Administrator for review and approval. <E T="03">See</E> 40 CFR 130.7(d)(1). Within 30 days of a state's submission, EPA must approve or disapprove the state's list. If EPA disapproves the state's 303(d) list, it must identify the impaired waters that should be listed within 30 days from the date of disapproval. EPA regulations provide that the Regional Administrator must promptly issue a public notice seeking comment on EPA's listing decision. After considering public comment and making appropriate revisions, the Region is required to transmit the list to the state. <E T="03">See</E> 40 CFR 130.7(d)(2).</P>

        <P>Under Section 303(d)(1)(C) of the CWA, each state is required to establish TMDLs for 303(d) listed waters. <E T="03">See also</E> 40 CFR 130.7(c)(1). After a state develops a TMDL, the state must submit the TMDL to EPA for review and approval. <E T="03">See</E> 40 CFR 130.7(d)(1). Within 30 days of a state's submission, EPA must approve or disapprove the state's TMDL. If EPA disapproves the state's TMDL, it must establish the TMDL within 30 days from the date of disapproval. EPA may also establish TMDLs in certain circumstances where the State has not previously submitted a TMDL for review. EPA regulations provide that the Regional Administrator must promptly issue a public notice seeking comment on EPA's TMDL. After considering public comment and making appropriate revisions, the Region is required to transmit the TMDL to the state. <E T="03">See</E> 40 CFR 130.7(d)(2).</P>

        <P>In the past, EPA Region 5 has issued public notices through publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>. In light of EPA's quest for improvements in efficiency, EPA Region 5 intends to notify the public of listing and TMDL actions under 40 CFR 130.7(d)(2) by placing notices directly on the Regional Internet Page rather than by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The Region believes that placing the notices on the 303(d)/TMDL Program Web page (<E T="03">http://www.epa.gov/tmdl/impaired-waters-<PRTPAGE P="22264"/>and-tmdls-region-5</E>) provides a more effective, and efficient of providing notice. The Region also plans to issue notifications to the affected states so that these states can include links to the notices on their state Web sites. The letters and accompanying documents transmitting final lists and/or federal TMDLs to the state will also be accessible from the 303(d)/TMDL Program Web page.</P>
        <P>To the extent that this announcement may be considered a rule, EPA considers it to be a procedural rule, which is exempt from notice and comment rulemaking requirements under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A).</P>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Needs and Uses:</E> On November 20, 2015, in document FCC 15-156, the Commission released a <E T="03">Second Report and Order, Order on Reconsideration, and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,</E> MB Docket No. 12-108, FCC 15-156, adopting additional rules implementing Sections 204 and 205 of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010 (CVAA) related to accessible user interfaces and video programming guides and menus. These rules are codified at 47 CFR 79.107 and 79.108. First, the <E T="03">Second Report and Order</E> implements Section 204's requirement that both the “appropriate built-in apparatus functions” and the “on-screen text menus or other visual indicators built in to the digital apparatus” to access such functions be “usable by individuals who are blind or visually impaired” by relying on the existing definition of “usable” in Section 6.3(l) of the Commission's rules. The 6.3(l) definition of “usable” requires that “individuals with disabilities have access to the full functionality and documentation for the product, including instructions, product information (including accessible feature information), documentation, bills and technical support which is provided to individuals without disabilities.” In addition, the <E T="03">Second Report and Order</E> adopts information, documentation, and training requirements comparable to those in Section 6.11 of the Commission's rules for entities covered by both Section 204 and Section 205 of the CVAA. The <E T="03">Second Report and Order</E> also adopts consumer notification requirements for equipment manufacturers of digital apparatus and navigation devices that will require manufacturers to publicize the availability of accessible devices on manufacturer Web sites that must be accessible to those with disabilities. The <E T="03">Second Report and Order</E> requires MVPDs, as well as manufacturers, to ensure that the contact office or person listed on their Web site is able to answer both general and specific questions about the availability of accessible equipment, including, if necessary, providing information to consumers or directing consumers to a place where they can locate information about how to activate and use accessibility features.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">The following rule sections and other requirements contain new and revised information collection requirements for which the Commission is seeking approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB):</E>
        </P>
        <P>(1) Usability requirements for manufacturers of digital apparatus.</P>
        <P>The <E T="03">Second Report and Order</E> adopts usability requirements for digital apparatus covered by 47 CFR 79.107. A digital apparatus manufacturer must make functions that are used for the reception, play back, or display of video programming, as well as on-screen text menus or other visual indicators used to access these functions, usable to individuals who are blind or visually impaired. Pursuant to 47 CFR 79.107(a)(5), the term “usable” means that individuals with disabilities have access to information and documentation on the full functionalities of digital apparatus, including instructions, product information (including accessible feature information), documentation, bills, and technical support which are provided to individuals without disabilities.</P>
        <P>(2) Information, documentation, and training requirements for manufacturers of digital apparatus. </P>
        <P>Pursuant to 47 CFR 79.107(d), manufacturers of digital apparatus must ensure access to information and documentation provided to customers, including user guides, bills, installation guides for end-user installable devices, and product support communications, regarding both the product in general and the accessibility features of the product. Manufacturers of digital apparatus must include the contact method for obtaining this information and documentation in general product information. Manufacturers should take such other steps as necessary including providing a description of the accessibility and compatibility features of the product and end-user product documentation upon request in alternate formats or alternate modes at no additional charge; and ensuring usable customer support and technical support in the call centers and service centers which support their products at no additional charge. In developing training programs, manufacturers of digital apparatus must consider the following topics: (i) Accessibility requirements of individuals with disabilities; (ii) means of communicating with individuals with disabilities; (iii) commonly used adaptive technology used with the manufacturer's products; (iv) designing for accessibility; and (v) solutions for accessibility and compatibility.</P>
        <P>(3) Information, documentation, and training requirements for covered MVPDs and manufacturers of navigation devices.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to 47 CFR 79.108(f), covered MVPDs and manufacturers of navigation devices must ensure access to information and documentation provided to customers, including user guides, bills, installation guides for end-user installable devices, and product support communications, regarding both the product in general and the accessibility features of the product. MVPDs and manufacturers of navigation devices must include the contact method for obtaining this information and documentation in general product information. MVPDs and manufacturers should take such other steps as necessary including providing a description of the accessibility and compatibility features of the product and end-user product documentation upon request in alternate formats or alternate modes at no additional charge; and ensuring usable customer support and technical support in the call centers and service centers which support their products at no additional charge. In developing training programs, MVPDs and manufacturers of navigation devices must consider the following topics: (i) Accessibility requirements of individuals with disabilities; (ii) means of communicating with individuals with disabilities; (iii) commonly used adaptive technology used with the manufacturer's products; (iv) designing for accessibility; and (v) solutions for accessibility and compatibility. If a consumer with a disability requests an accessible navigation device, this also constitutes a request for a description of the accessibility features of the device and end-user product documentation in accessible formats.</P>

        <P>(4) Notifications by covered manufacturers regarding the availability of accessible digital apparatus. Pursuant to 47 CFR 79.107(e), manufacturers of digital apparatus must provide notice on their official Web sites about the availability of accessible devices. Manufacturers must prominently display information about accessible devices and solutions on their Web sites in a way that makes such information available to all consumers and in a format that is accessible to people with disabilities. The notice for digital apparatus must publicize the availability of accessible devices and the specific person, office or entity who can answer consumer questions about <PRTPAGE P="22268"/>which products contain the required accessibility features. The contact office or person listed on the Web site must be able to answer both general and specific questions about the availability of accessible equipment, including, if necessary, providing information to consumers or directing consumers to a place where they can locate information about how to activate and use accessibility features.</P>
        <P>(5) Notifications by covered manufacturers regarding the availability of accessible navigation devices.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to 47 CFR 79.108(d)(2), manufacturers of navigation devices must provide notice on their official Web sites about the availability of accessible devices.

          <E T="03">Needs and Uses:</E> The Commission uses the study area boundary data collected for this information collection to implement certain universal service reforms. The Universal Service Fund supports the deployment of voice and broadband-capable infrastructure in rural, high cost areas. High-cost support is granted to a carrier based on the characteristics of its “study area,” the geographic area served by an incumbent local exchange carrier within a state. Therefore, complete and accurate study area boundary data are essential for calculating a carrier's costs and expenses, which in turn determine the amount of support that carrier can receive to serve high-cost areas. Initial study area boundaries were submitted in 2013. These maps were submitted via a secure Internet-browser web interface developed and maintained by the Commission. If a study area boundary changes, filers are required to submit, via this interface, revised boundary data incorporating such changes by March 15 of the year following the change. In addition, all filers are required to recertify their study area boundaries every two years.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Introduction</HD>

        <P>This notice informs the public of FHFA's proposal to revise in its entirety an existing system of records. This notice satisfies the Privacy Act requirement that an agency publish a system of records notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> when there is an addition to the agency's system of records. It has been recognized by Congress that application of all requirements of the Privacy Act to certain categories of records may have an undesirable and often unacceptable effect upon agencies in the conduct of necessary public business. Consequently, Congress established general exemptions and specific exemptions that could be used to exempt records from provisions of the Privacy Act. Congress also required that exempting records from provisions of the Privacy Act would require the head of an agency to publish a determination to exempt a record from the Privacy Act as a rule in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act. The Director of FHFA has determined that records and information in this revised system of records are not exempt from requirements of the Privacy Act.</P>
        <P>As required by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), and pursuant to paragraph 4c of Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A-130, “Federal Agency Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals,” dated February 8, 1996 (61 FR 6428, 6435 (February 20, 1996)), FHFA has submitted a report describing the revised system of records covered by this notice, to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget.</P>
        <P>The revised system of records described above is set forth in its entirety below.</P>

          <HD SOURCE="HD2">PURPOSE(S):</HD>

          <P>The purpose of this system of records is to maintain emergency contact <PRTPAGE P="22270"/>information for current FHFA employees and contractor personnel. The system provides for high-speed message delivery that reaches all agency and contractor personnel in response to threat alerts issued by the Department of Homeland Security, weather related emergencies, or other critical situations that disrupt the operations of and accessibility to an FHFA worksite. The system also provides for personnel accountability during an emergency, through personnel sign-in and rapid alert and notification.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">ROUTINE USES OF RECORDS MAINTAINED IN THE SYSTEM, INCLUDING CATEGORIES OF USERS AND THE PURPOSE OF SUCH USES:</HD>
          <P>In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, these records or information contained therein may specifically be disclosed outside FHFA as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) When (a) it is suspected or confirmed that the security or confidentiality of information in the system of records has been compromised; (b) FHFA has determined that as a result of the suspected or confirmed compromise there is a risk of harm to economic or property interests, identity theft or fraud, or harm to the security or integrity of this system or other systems or programs (whether maintained by FHFA or another agency or entity) that rely upon the compromised information; and (c) the disclosure is made to such agencies, entities, and persons who are reasonably necessary to assist in connection with FHFA's efforts to respond to the suspected or confirmed compromise and prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm.</P>
          <P>(2) Records in this system may be disclosed to any individual during the course of any inquiry or investigation conducted by FHFA, or in connection with civil or administrative litigation, if FHFA has reason to believe that the individual to whom the record is disclosed may have further information about the matters related therein, and those matters appeared to be relevant at the time to the subject matter of the inquiry.</P>
          <P>(3) A record or information in the system may be disclosed to any individual with whom FHFA contracts to reproduce, by typing, photocopy or other means, any record within this system for use by FHFA and its employees in connection with their official duties or to any individual who is utilized by FHFA to perform clerical or stenographic functions relating to the official business of FHFA.</P>
          <P>(4) To appropriate federal, state, and local authorities responsible for investigating or prosecuting a violation of, or for enforcing or implementing a statute, rule, regulation, or order issued, when the information indicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal, or regulatory in nature, and whether arising by general statute or particular program statute, or by regulation, rule, or order issued pursuant thereto.</P>
          <P>(5) To a court, magistrate, or other administrative body in the course of presenting evidence, including disclosures to counsel or witnesses in the course of civil discovery, litigation, or settlement negotiations or in connection with criminal proceedings, when FHFA is a party to the proceeding or has a significant interest in the proceeding, to the extent that the information is determined to be relevant and necessary.</P>
          <P>(6) To a Congressional office from the record of an individual in response to an inquiry from the Congressional office made at the request of that individual.</P>
          <P>(7) To contractor personnel, interns, and others performing or working on a contract, service, grant, cooperative agreement, or project for FHFA.</P>
          <P>(8) To any Federal government authority for the purpose of coordinating with or reviewing FHFA's continuity of operations plans or emergency contingency plans.</P>
          <P>(9) To any Federal, State or Local government authority for the purpose of coordinating a response to threat alerts issued by the Department of Homeland Security, weather related emergencies, or other critical situations that disrupt the operations of and accessibility to an FHFA worksite.</P>
          <P>(10) To the National Archives and Records Administration, Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), to the extent necessary to fulfill its responsibilities in 5 U.S.C. 552(b), to review administrative agency policies, procedures and compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and to facilitate OGIS' offering of mediation services to resolve disputes between persons making FOIA requests and administrative agencies.</P>

        <P>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), federal agencies must obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for each collection of information they conduct or sponsor. The term “collection of information” is defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and includes agency requests or requirements that members of the public submit reports, keep records, or provide information to a third party. Section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) requires federal agencies to publish a 30-day notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension or reinstatement of an existing collection of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with this requirement, CMS is publishing this notice that summarizes the following proposed collection(s) of information for public comment:</P>

Health Care Prepayment Plans (HCPPs) contracting with the Secretary under Section 1833 of the Social Security Act are required to submit a budget and enrollment forecast, semi-annual interim report, and final cost report in accordance with 42 CFR 417.808 and 42 CFR 417.810. <E T="03">Form Number:</E> CMS-276 (OMB control number 0938-0165); <E T="03">Frequency:</E> Quarterly; <E T="03">Affected Public:</E> Private Sector (Business or other for-profits); <E T="03">Number of Respondents:</E> 91; <E T="03">Total Annual Responses:</E> 74; <E T="03">Total Annual Hours:</E> 3728.

The purpose of the State Buy-in' program is to assure that Medicaid is the payer of last resort by permitting a State to provide Medicare protection to certain groups of needy individuals, as part of the State's total assistance plan. State Buy-in also has the effect of transferring some medical costs for this population from the Medicaid program, which is partially State funded to the Medicare program, which is funded by the federal government and individual premiums. Generally, the States Buy-in for individuals who meet the eligibility requirements for Medicare and are cash recipients or deemed cash recipients or categorically needy under Medicaid. In some cases, States may also include individuals who are not cash assistance recipients under the Medical Assistance Only group. The day-to-day operations of the State Buy-in program is accomplished through an automated data exchange process. The automated data exchange process is used to exchange Medicare and Buy-in entitlement information between the Social Security District Offices, Medicaid State Agencies and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. When problems arise however that cannot be resolved though the normal data exchange process, clerical actions are required. The CMS-1957, “SSO Report of State Buy-In Problem” is used to report Buy-in problems cases. The CMS-1957 is the only standardized form available for communications between the aforementioned agencies for the resolution of beneficiary complaints and inquiries regarding State Buy-in eligibility. <E T="03">Form Number:</E> CMS-1957 (OMB control number: 0938-0035); <E T="03">Frequency:</E> Reporting—Annually; <E T="03">Affected Public:</E> Individuals and Households; <E T="03">Number of Respondents:</E> 3,936; <E T="03">Total Annual Responses:</E> 3,936; <E T="03">Total Annual Hours:</E> 1,311.

        <P>In FY 2014, OCSE competitively awarded a cooperative agreement to the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services to conduct a 5-year evaluation of OCSE's national demonstration called Behavioral Interventions for Child Support Services (BICS).</P>
        <P>This supplement will allow the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services to develop additional dissemination tools such as reports and web-based trainings on the lessons learned and early findings from the evaluation of Behavioral Interventions for Child Support Services Demonstration.</P>
        <P>The cost of the BICS evaluation is larger than originally budgeted because the process mapping and project design phase has been significantly slower than anticipated for the grantees. This has led to the need for increased technical assistance to the BICS grantees by the evaluation grantee. Additionally, as a result of the mapping and design phase, OCSE anticipates an increased number of interesting findings that will be of benefit to the greater child support field.</P>
        <P>The supplement funds will allow Washington State Department of Social and Health Services to provide increased technical assistance to the BICS demonstration sites, and support the development additional dissemination tools such as reports and web-based trainings on the lessons learned and early findings from the Evaluation of BICS.</P>
        <P>Specifically, the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services will explore the development of innovative, user-friendly tools such as podcasts and infographics that will provide research findings and learning to the child support community in a way that is easily accessible to interested program administrators and policy officials.

The proposed information collection consists of site visits by staff from the Urban Institute and Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago to conduct formative evaluations of programs serving transition-age foster youth. The evaluations will include preliminary visits to discuss the evaluation process with program administrators. Then, the research team will conduct site visits to each program to speak with program leaders, partners and key stakeholders, front-line staff, and participants. These formative evaluations will determine programs' readiness for more rigorous evaluation in the future. The activities and products from this project will help ACF to fulfill their ongoing legislative mandate for program evaluation specified in the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Respondents:</E> Program leaders, partners and stakeholders, and front-line staff as well as young adults being served by the programs.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive, or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.</P>

        <P>A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: A testing phase and <PRTPAGE P="22277"/>an approval phase. For human biological products, the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the biological becomes effective and runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the human biological product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the biological product. Although only a portion of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Director of USPTO may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human biological product will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).</P>
        <P>FDA has approved for marketing the human biologic product CYRAMZA (ramucirumab). CYRAMZA is indicated for treatment of gastric cancer. Subsequent to this approval, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) received a patent term restoration application for CYRAMZA (U.S. Patent No. 7,498,414) from Eli Lilly and Co., and the USPTO requested FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated March 19, 2015, FDA advised the USPTO that this human biological product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval of CYRAMZA represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Thereafter, the USPTO requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Determination of Regulatory Review Period</HD>
        <P>FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for CYRAMZA is 3,521 days. Of this time, 3,279 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 242 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:</P>
        <P>1. <E T="03">The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(i)) became effective:</E> September 1, 2004. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the date the investigational new drug application (IND) became effective was on September 1, 2004.</P>
        <P>2. <E T="03">The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human biological product under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262</E>): August 23, 2013. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the biologics license application (BLA) for CYRAMZA (BLA 125477) was initially submitted on August 23, 2013.</P>
        <P>3. <E T="03">The date the application was approved:</E> April 21, 2014. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that BLA 125477 was approved on April 21, 2014.</P>
        <P>This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension. However, the USPTO applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,059 days of patent term extension.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Petitions</HD>

        <P>Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published are incorrect may submit either electronic or written comments and ask for a redetermination (see <E T="02">DATES</E>). Furthermore, any interested person may petition FDA for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must be timely (see <E T="02">DATES</E>) and contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.</P>
        <P>Submit petitions electronically to <E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov</E> at Docket No. FDA-2013-S-0610. Submit written petitions (two copies are required) to the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.</P>

        <P>In compliance with 44 U.S.C. 3507, FDA has submitted the following proposed collection of information to OMB for review and clearance.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Center for Devices and Radiological Health Appeals Processes—</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">OMB Control Number 0910-0738—Extension</HD>
        <P>The guidance document entitled “Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff; Center for Devices and Radiological Health Appeals Processes” describes the processes available to outside stakeholders to request additional review of decisions or actions by Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) employees. FDA is seeking approval for the new reporting burden associated with requests for additional review of decisions and actions by CDRH employees as described in the guidance.</P>

        <P>Individuals outside of FDA who disagree with a decision or action taken by CDRH and wish to have it reviewed or reconsidered have several processes for resolution from which to choose, including: Requests for supervisory review of an action; petitions; and hearings. Of these, by far the most commonly used is a request for supervisory review under § 10.75 (21 CFR 10.75) (a “10.75 appeal”). Section 517A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&amp;C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360g-1), added by section 603 of the Food and Drug Safety and Innovation <PRTPAGE P="22278"/>Act of 2012, includes new requirements pertaining to the process and timelines for 10.75 appeals of “significant decisions” regarding 510(k) premarket notifications, applications for premarket approvals (PMAs), and applications for investigational device exemptions (IDEs).</P>
        <P>A request for review under § 10.75 should be based on the information that was already present in the administrative file at the time of the decision that is being reviewed as provided in § 10.75(d). New section 517A of the FD&amp;C Act refers to significant decisions regarding the information in the administrative file for premarket notifications (section 510(k)); PMAs (section 515); and IDEs (section 520(g)) submissions is collected under existing regulations which specify the information manufacturers must submit so that FDA may properly evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. The information collections associated with these regulations are currently approved by the Office of Management and Budget as follows: The collections of information in 21 CFR part 807, subpart E (premarket notification) have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0120; the collections of information in 21 CFR part 814 (premarket approval) have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0231; and the collections of information in 21 CFR part 812 (investigational device exemption) have been approved under OMB control number 0910-0078.</P>
        <P>While CDRH already possesses in the administrative file the information that would form the basis of a decision on a matter under appeal, the submission of particular information regarding the request itself and the data and information relied on by the requestor in the appeal would facilitate timely resolution of the decision under review. The guidance describes the collection of information not expressly specified under existing regulations such as: The submission of the request for review, minor clarifications as part of the request, and supporting information.</P>
        <P>In the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of October 21, 2015 (80 FR 63804), FDA published a 60-day notice requesting public comment on the proposed collection of information. No comments were received.</P>

        <P>On November 27, 2013, the DSCSA (Title II of Pub. L. 113-54) was signed into law. The DSCSA outlines critical steps to build an electronic, interoperable system by November 27, 2023, which will identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed within the United States. Section 202 of the DSCSA added new sections 581 and 582 to the Food Drug <PRTPAGE P="22280"/>and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360eee and 360eee-1). Under section 582(j), FDA is required to establish one or more pilot projects, in coordination with authorized manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers, to explore and evaluate methods to enhance the safety and security of the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. The projects established by FDA will take into consideration any pilot projects that were conducted prior to enactment of the DSCSA.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Purpose of the Request for Information</HD>
        <P>The request for information is intended to provide interested persons an opportunity to submit comments relating to FDA's implementation of the DSCSA. We are particularly interested in comments regarding past or present pilot projects related to enhancing the safety and security of the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. Stakeholders that may be interested in responding to this request for information include: Manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, State and Federal authorities, solution providers, standards organizations, and other interested persons. FDA is particularly interested in learning about the practices, processes, and systems that supply chain stakeholders have used or considered using in such pilot projects. This includes, but is not limited to, information about the following:</P>
        <P>• Utilizing the product identifier for tracing of a product, which may include verification of the product identifier of a product, including the use of aggregation and inference;</P>
        <P>• Technical capabilities each sector of the supply chain to comply with systems and processes needed to utilize the product identifier to enhance the tracing of a product; or</P>
        <P>• System attributes that are necessary to implement the requirements established under the DSCSA.</P>
        <P>Interested persons are requested to provide any other relevant information that may assist with FDA's development of a pilot project under the DSCSA.</P>

          <E T="03">Agenda:</E> On June 2 and 3, 2016, the committee will discuss recent reports and epidemiologic investigations of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections associated with the use of heater-cooler devices during cardiac surgical procedures. FDA is convening this committee to seek expert scientific and clinical opinion related to contamination of heater-cooler devices, associated patient infections, and mitigation strategies based on available scientific information. The committee will make recommendations on: (1) The effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection methods for heater-cooler devices; (2) the amount and type of premarket data and information needed to demonstrate validation of cleaning and disinfection of heater-cooler devices in support of labeling claims and technical instructions; (3) appropriate risk mitigations to be implemented by manufacturers of heater-cooler devices and/or hospital facilities to ensure patient safety during surgical procedures where these devices are used; and (4) appropriate guidelines and/or criteria based on a risk stratification schema for notifying patients who may have already been exposed to NTM during prior cardiac surgeries. Recommendations on these issues will assist FDA in minimizing patient exposure to infections that may result from contaminated heater-cooler devices.</P>

        <P>FDA intends to make background material available to the public no later than 2 business days before the meeting. If FDA is unable to post the background material on its Web site prior to the meeting, the background material will be made publicly available at the location of the advisory committee meeting, and the background material will be posted on FDA's Web site after the meeting.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>FDA is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled “Data Integrity and Compliance With CGMP.” Increased CGMP violations involving data integrity observed in recent CGMP inspections have led to numerous regulatory actions, including warning letters, import alerts, and consent decrees. The purpose of this draft guidance is to clarify the role of data integrity in CGMP for drugs, as required in 21 CFR parts 210, 211, and 212.</P>

        <P>The draft guidance addresses specific questions about how data integrity relates to compliance with CGMP for drugs, as well as more general data integrity concepts, in question and answer format. Parts of this draft guidance have been previously published on the FDA Web site in <E T="03">Questions and Answers on Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Good Guidance Practices, Level 2 Guidance—Records and Reports</E> (Q&amp;A Level 2 guidance). When finalized, this draft guidance will replace the Q&amp;A Level 2 guidance on data integrity in CGMP.</P>
        <P>This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on data integrity and compliance with CGMP. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.</P>

        <P>In the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of June 11, 2010 (75 FR 33311), FDA announced the availability of a guidance for industry entitled “Bioequivalence Recommendations for Specific Products” that explained the process that would be used to make product-specific BE recommendations available to the public on FDA's Web site at <E T="03">http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.</E>
        </P>

        <P>As described in that guidance, FDA adopted this process as a means to develop and disseminate product-specific BE recommendations and provide a meaningful opportunity for the public to consider and comment on those recommendations. Under that process, draft recommendations are posted on FDA's Web site and announced periodically in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The public is encouraged to submit comments on those recommendations within 60 days of their announcement in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>. FDA considers any comments received and either publishes final recommendations or publishes revised draft recommendations for comment. Recommendations were last announced in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on January 28, 2016 (81 FR 4913). This notice announces draft product-specific recommendations, either new or revised, that are posted on FDA's Web site.</P>

        <P>The Committee is chartered under section 1111 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, 42 U.S.C. 300b-10, as amended by the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Act). The Committee was established in 2003 to advise the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regarding newborn screening tests, technologies, policies, guidelines, and programs for effectively reducing morbidity and mortality in newborns and children having or at risk for heritable disorders. In addition, the Committee provides advice and recommendations to the Secretary concerning the grants and projects authorized under section 1109 of the PHS Act and technical information to develop policies and priorities for grants, including those that will enhance the ability of the state and local health agencies to provide for newborn and child screening, counseling and health care services for newborns, and children having or at risk for heritable disorders.</P>

        <P>The Committee is governed by the provisions of Public Law 92-463, as amended (5 U.S.C. App. 2), and 41 CFR part 102-3, which set forth standards for the formation and use of advisory committees. The Committee reviews and reports regularly on newborn and childhood screening practices for heritable disorders, recommends improvements in the national newborn and childhood heritable screening programs, and recommends conditions for inclusion in the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). The Committee's recommendations regarding additional conditions/inherited disorders for screening that have been adopted by the Secretary are included in the RUSP and constitute part of the comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration. Pursuant to section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. 300gg-13, non-grandfathered health plans and group and individual health insurance issuers are required to cover screenings included in the HRSA-supported comprehensive guidelines without charging a co-payment, co-insurance, or deductible for plan years (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> in the individual market, policy years) beginning on or after the date that is 1 year from the Secretary's adoption of the condition for screening.</P>

        <P>Nominations: HRSA is requesting nominations to fill three (3) positions for voting members to serve on the Committee. Nominations of potential candidates for consideration are being sought for individuals who are medical, technical, or scientific professionals with special expertise in the field of heritable disorders or in providing screening, counseling, testing, or specialty services for newborns and children at risk for heritable disorders; who have expertise in ethics (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> bioethics) and infectious diseases and who have worked and published material in the area of newborn screening; members of the public having special expertise about or concern with heritable disorders; or representatives from such federal agencies, public health constituencies, and medical professional societies as determined to be necessary by the Secretary to fulfill the duties of the Advisory Committee established under subsection (b) of section 1111 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, 42 U.S.C. 300b-10, as amended by the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Act). Interested applicants may self-nominate or be nominated by another individual and/or organization.</P>
        <P>Individuals selected for appointment to the Committee will be invited to serve for up to 4 years. Members who are not federal officers or permanent federal employees are appointed as special government employees and receive a stipend and reimbursement for per diem and any travel expenses incurred for attending Committee meetings and/or conducting other business on behalf of the Committee, as authorized by section 5 U.S.C. 5703 for persons employed intermittently in government service. Members who are officers or employees of the United States Government shall not receive additional compensation for service on the Committee, but receive per diem and travel expenses incurred for attending Committee meetings and/or conducting other business on behalf of the Committee. Nominees will be invited to serve during calendar year 2017.</P>

        <P>The following information must be included in the package of materials <PRTPAGE P="22286"/>submitted for each individual being nominated for consideration: (1) A statement that clearly states the name and affiliation of the nominee, the basis for the nomination (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> specific attributes such as expertise in bioethics, evidence review, public health, laboratory, maternal and child health, or clinical expertise in heritable disorders, which qualify the nominee for service in this capacity), and that the nominee is willing to serve as a member of the Committee; (2) the nominee's name, address, and daytime telephone number and the home/or work address, telephone number, and email address; and (3) a current copy of the nominee's curriculum vitae. Nomination packages may be summited directly by the individual being nominated or by the person/organization recommending the candidate.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Human Services will make every effort to ensure that the membership of the Committee is fairly balanced in terms of points of view represented. Every effort is made to ensure that individuals from a broad representation of geographic areas, gender, ethnic and minority groups, as well as individuals with disabilities are given consideration for membership. Appointments shall be made without discrimination on the basis of age, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and cultural, religious, or socioeconomic status.</P>
        <P>Individuals who are selected to be considered for appointment will be required to provide detailed information regarding their financial holdings, consultancies, and research grants or contracts. Disclosure of this information is necessary in order to determine if the selected candidate is involved in any activity that may pose a potential conflict with the official duties to be performed as a member of the Committee.</P>

          <P>The NIH OSP is amending portions of the <E T="03">NIH Guidelines</E> in order to provide investigators with biosafety guidance regarding the standards for containment of non-human primates (NHPs) in biosafety level (BL) 4 laboratories and to make such guidance consistent with the expectations articulated in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/NIH Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories 5th edition (BMBL). Specifically, the <E T="03">NIH Guidelines</E> will allow for housing of NHPs in open caging in a dedicated animal holding room provided there are two physical barriers between that animal holding room and non-containment space within the laboratory, the animal holding room has negative air pressure with respect to any adjacent non-containment corridors, and there are specific decontamination protocols in place before the door to the animal holding room is opened to allow for the periodic transfer of new animals into the room. These amendments do not change the current containment requirements in the <E T="03">NIH Guidelines</E> but rather offer an alternative for achieving primary containment without compromising safety.</P>
          <P>In addition, the recertification requirement for biosafety cabinets in BL4 laboratories is updated in recognition of the technological standards for modern biosafety cabinets. The NIH OSP also is updating the validation requirements for equipment responsible for centralized heat decontamination of liquid effluents in laboratories working with large animals.</P>
          <P>These amendments to the <E T="03">NIH Guidelines</E> will be implemented immediately upon publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>. These changes were developed after extensive consultation with biosafety experts, directors of and principal investigators in BL4 facilities working with NHPs, and CDC's Division of Select Agent and Toxins (DSAT) leadership at a public workshop and discussion at a public Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) meeting. Publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> will inform the scientific and biosafety communities.</P>

However, in the early 1990s, the BMBL was amended and the fourth edition stated that animals housed in BL4 suit laboratories (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> laboratories in which Class III cabinets are not used but instead personnel wear positive pressure protective suits) <E T="03">should</E> be housed in a primary containment system (such as open cages covered with filtered bonnets and opened in laminar flow hoods or other equivalent containment systems). This language remains in the current BMBL (5th edition). With the change in the BMBL, primary containment caging was arguably preferred but no longer required under BL4 containment. In contrast, the <E T="03">NIH Guidelines</E> have always required primary containment caging for all animals in BL4 laboratories.</P>

        <P>Non-human primates are social animals and require environmental enrichment. Researchers in several U.S.  BL4 laboratories engaged in NHP research approached the NIH OSP with concerns that primary containment caging in BL4 laboratories hindered the creation of an environment that allowed animals to benefit from adequate social interaction. Also based on risk assessments and experiences comparing several primary containment caging systems, the researchers concluded that primary containment caging may actually create new hazards for laboratory workers. These findings included interference with observation of the animals from outside the room leading to more frequent entries into the BL4 animal room to monitor the animals, and exacerbation of cramped working conditions created by the additional barriers required by some containment systems, which increases the difficulty of working in inflated pressure suits as well as the potential for damage to the pressure suit. In addition, investigators stated that current BL4 laboratory designs incorporate sophisticated engineering systems, which provide biosafety protection in a dedicated animal room equivalent to the primary containment caging required under the <E T="03">NIH <PRTPAGE P="22287"/>Guidelines.</E> On March 28, 2014, the NIH OSP, together with the CDC Division of Select Agents (DSAT), held a meeting with investigators and biosafety personnel from nine BL4 laboratories in the U.S. and five international laboratories (agenda and roster available at <E T="03">http://osp.od.nih.gov/office-biotechnology-activities/event/2014-03-28-120000-2014-03-28-211500/primary-containment-non-human-primates-biosafety-level-4-laboratories-challenges-and-best-practices</E>). That meeting was followed by a discussion at the June 11, 2014, meeting of the NIH RAC regarding housing of NHPs in BL4 laboratories (a webcast of that discussion is available at <E T="03">http://videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?Live=14300&amp;bhcp=1.</E>)</P>

        <P>As a result of these discussions and after consultation with CDC DSAT, the NIH OSP is amending the <E T="03">NIH Guidelines</E> to allow the housing of NHP in open cages in a dedicated animal room provided certain conditions as articulated below are met.</P>
        <P>In addition, OSP is updating the requirement for testing and certification of Class I and II biosafety cabinets at BL4 from every six months to annually, recognizing the technological advances in biosafety cabinet design and engineering that have occurred over the period since this performance measure was originally implemented.</P>
        <P>Finally, Appendix Q of the <E T="03">NIH Guidelines</E> currently requires that the centralized heat treatment catch tank system in BL4 large animal laboratories be validated every 30 days. To carry out this testing effectively, the system should be near capacity (<E T="03">i.e.</E> “under load”). Some laboratories do not use their catch tank systems on a regular basis; therefore, a mandatory 30 day validation would require them to demonstrate that the equipment is functioning when it is not in use or is not at capacity. This will not serve the intended purpose of demonstrating that the equipment is functioning as intended. Therefore, validation intervals will need to be set based on the utilization of the system provided it is done at least once a year.</P>
        <P>To implement these changes, the following sections of the <E T="03">NIH Guidelines</E> are to be amended:</P>
        <P>Appendix G-II-D-2-l. currently states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>Appendix G-II-D-2-l. Laboratory animals involved in experiments requiring BL4 level physical containment shall be housed either in cages contained in Class III cabinets or in partial containment caging systems, such as Horsfall units (see Appendix G-III-K, <E T="03">Footnotes and References of Appendix G</E>), open cages placed in ventilated enclosures, or solid-wall and -bottom cages placed on holding racks equipped with ultraviolet irradiation lamps and reflectors that are located in a specially designed area in which all personnel are required to wear one-piece positive pressure suits.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>Appendix G-II-D-2-1 is amended as follows with the addition of a new Appendix G-II-D-2-1-(2) that will address housing of NHPs:</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Appendix G-II-D-2-l. Containment for Animal Research</HD>

        <P>Appendix G-II-D-2-l-(1). Laboratory animals involved in experiments requiring BL4 level physical containment shall be housed either in cages contained in Class III cabinets or in partial containment caging systems, such as Horsfall units (see Appendix G-III-K, <E T="03">Footnotes and References of Appendix G</E>), open cages placed in ventilated enclosures, or solid-wall and -bottom cages placed on holding racks equipped with ultraviolet irradiation lamps and reflectors that are located in a specially designed area in which all personnel are required to wear one-piece positive pressure suits.</P>
        <P>Appendix G-II-D-2-l-(2). Non-human primates (NHP) may be housed (1) under the containment conditions described in Appendix G-II-D-2-l-(1) above, or (2) in open cages within a dedicated animal holding room that serves as the primary barrier and in which all personnel are required to wear one-piece positive pressure suits. A room serving as a primary barrier must be air-tight and capable of being decontaminated using fumigation. If NHPs are to be contained in a dedicated animal holding room serving as the primary barrier, the following conditions shall be met:</P>
        <P>(i) Access to the animal holding room from service corridors outside of the BL4 containment space shall require passage through two sets of doors, and the inner most door must be an air pressure resistant (APR) door;</P>
        <P>(ii) For any animal holding room considered to be a primary barrier, APR door(s) providing direct ingress from the exterior service corridor shall be fitted with appropriate and redundant lock-out mechanisms to prevent access when the animal holding room is contaminated and in use. There should be more than one mechanism to ensure that this primary barrier door cannot be opened when the animal room is contaminated and the APR door shall not serve as an emergency exit from the BL4 laboratory. The APR door shall be appropriately tested to demonstrate that in the closed, locked-out mode, the door provides an air-tight barrier proven by pressure decay testing or other equivalent method;</P>

        <P>(iii) Any door(s) allowing access into a corridor from which there is direct ingress to an animal holding room must be fitted with either (1) an APR door or (2) a non-APR door, providing directional airflow is maintained from the laboratory corridor space into the animal room. For the purpose of fumigation, animal rooms equipped with non-APR doors opening into the adjacent interior corridors shall be considered one space (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> areas between air-tight doors shall be fumigated together).</P>
        <P>(iv) Any door(s) used for access to the service corridor (the secondary barrier) shall be self-closing and of solid construction, designed not to corrode, split or warp;</P>
        <P>(v) Access to the service corridor inside the secondary barrier shall be restricted and strictly controlled when animal rooms are in use. Whenever possible, the secondary barrier door(s) should be fitted with safety interlock switches designed to prevent it from opening when an animal holding room door (the primary barrier) is opened following room decontamination; if interlock devices cannot be used, specific administrative procedures shall be implemented to control access to the service corridor;</P>
        <P>(vi) The service corridor shall maintain a negative pressure (inward directional airflow) relative to adjoining traffic corridors;</P>
        <P>(vii) Prior to fumigation of the animal holding room, cages should be removed for autoclaving or chemical decontamination.</P>
        <P>(viii) Caging should be chosen to reduce the amount of animal detritus that can be thrown out of the cage and onto the floor of the animal holding room;</P>
        <P>(ix) The flow of personnel, material and equipment should be directed in order to minimize the spread of contamination from the animal holding room into adjacent areas of the laboratory.</P>
        <P>(x) Following animal room decontamination, safeguards involving the use of personal protective equipment and appropriate administrative controls shall be implemented for the safe retrieval of biological indicators in order to prevent the spread of infectious agents in the event of a decontamination failure.</P>

        <P>With regard to the frequency of class II biosafety cabinet recertification and testing, the <E T="03">NIH Guidelines</E> require recertification/testing of biosafety cabinets at six-month intervals. However, modern biosafety cabinet <PRTPAGE P="22288"/>design specifications incorporate continuous electronic and physical monitoring systems that track multiple operational parameters such as pressure differential, air flow velocity and plenum pressure with added capabilities for remote control and monitoring. Continuous performance monitoring and redundant safety features obviate the need for frequent testing of modern biosafety cabinets under normal conditions of use. Also the testing of biosafety cabinets in biomedical high containment (BL4) laboratories entails a complete shutdown of the laboratory for decontamination with appropriate sterilants to allow technicians to access the equipment safely. This procedure increases risks to laboratory staff working with the sterilants (often in the form of toxic gasses) and requires a halt to all research activities for an extended period of time depending on the number of cabinets to be tested or recertified. The NIH is in agreement with the recommendation of the BMBL that class II biosafety cabinets be tested and certified at least annually, with the understanding that retesting may have to be performed as needed at the discretion of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), if for example, equipment is moved or subject to unusual conditions of use.</P>
        <P>Appendix G-II-D-4-p currently states:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>

          <P>Appendix G-II-D-4-p. The treated exhaust air from Class I and II biological safety cabinets may be discharged into the laboratory room environment or the outside through the facility air exhaust system. If exhaust air from Class I or II biological safety cabinets is discharged into the laboratory the cabinets are tested and certified at six-month intervals. The exhaust air from Class III biological safety cabinets is discharged, without recirculation through two sets of high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters in series, via the facility exhaust air system. If the treated exhaust air from any of these cabinets is discharged to the outside through the facility exhaust air system, it is connected to this system in a manner (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> thimble unit connection (see Appendix G-III-L, Footnotes and References of Appendix G)) that avoids any interference with the air balance of the cabinets or the facility exhaust air system.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>Appendix G-II-D-4-p is amended as follows:</P>

        <P>Appendix G-II-D-4-p. The treated exhaust air from Class I and II biological safety cabinets may be discharged into the laboratory room environment or the outside through the facility air exhaust system. If exhaust air from Class I or II biological safety cabinets is discharged into the laboratory the cabinets are tested and certified at minimum on a yearly basis. More frequent testing and certification, based on the amount of use or other safety factors, shall be left to the discretion of the IBC. The exhaust air from Class III biological safety cabinets is discharged, without recirculation through two sets of high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters in series, via the facility exhaust air system. If the treated exhaust air from any of these cabinets is discharged to the outside through the facility exhaust air system, it is connected to this system in a manner (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> thimble unit connection (see Appendix G-III-L, <E T="03">Footnotes and References of Appendix G</E>)) that avoids any interference with the air balance of the cabinets or the facility exhaust air system.</P>

        <P>With regard to the periodic biologic validation of the centralized heat treatment process for all BL3 and BL4 facilities, the <E T="03">NIH Guidelines</E> requires that this process be performed every 30 days while the BMBL recommends at least an annual biological validation. Similar to biosafety cabinets, modern catch tank systems for heat treatment of all laboratory effluents have also become more sophisticated and now incorporate redundant monitoring systems to track temperature and pressure parameters during each heat treatment cycle. In addition it should be noted that proper validation of the heat treatment catch tank system requires that testing be performed when the system is at or near capacity (<E T="03">i.e.</E> “under load”)—more frequent validation of a heat treatment system that is below capacity may not serve the intended purpose of demonstrating that the equipment is functioning as intended. An additional margin of safety is achieved by monitoring sterilization cycle parameters on a routine basis. We are, therefore, in agreement with the recommendation of the BMBL that validation be performed as frequently as necessary at the discretion of the IBC and at least once annually to ensure that the centralized effluent heat treatment system is performing as intended under the established process parameters. This amendment shall apply to heat treatment systems used in both large animal BL3 and BL4 facilities.</P>

          <E T="03">Need and Use of Information Collection:</E> This collection of data is intended to assist in the reunification of family members and friends who are separated during a disaster. Experience in operational drills and during real-world disasters such as the January 2010 earthquakes in Haiti demonstrates that family members and loved ones are often separated during disasters and have significant difficulty determining each other's safety, condition, and location. Reunification can not only improve their emotional well-being during the recovery period, but also improve the chances that injured victims will be cared for once they are <PRTPAGE P="22290"/>released from urgent medical care. Family and friends are also a valuable source of medical information that may be important to the care of injured victims (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> by providing family or personal medical history, information about allergies). The National Library of Medicine (NLM) aims to assist Federal, State and Local agencies in disaster relief efforts and to serve its mission of supporting national efforts to the response to disasters via the PEOPLE LOCATOR® system and related mobile app (ReUnite<E T="51">TM</E>) developed as part of the intramural Lost Person Finder (LPF) R&amp;D project. The information collection would support efforts to reunite family and friends who are separated during a disaster. Information about missing (“lost”) people would be collected from family members or loved ones who are searching for them. Information about recovered (“found”) people could be provided by medical personnel, volunteers and other relief workers assisting in the disaster recovery effort. Information collected about missing and recovered persons would vary including any one of the following and possibly all: A photograph, name (if available for a found person), age group (child, adult) and/or range, gender, status (alive and well, injured, deceased, unknown), and location. The information collection would be voluntary. It would be activated only during times of declared emergencies, training and demonstration support activities, and would operate in declared emergencies until relief efforts have ceased in response to a particular disaster. This data collection is authorized pursuant to sections 301, 307, 465 and 478A of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 241, 242l, 286 and 286d]. NLM has in its mission the development and coordination of communication technology to improve the delivery of health services.</P>

          <E T="03">Need and Use of Information Collection:</E> This is a revision request (OMB number 0925-0664, expiration date 8/31/2018) for the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study to conduct the fourth wave of data collection. The PATH Study is a large national longitudinal cohort study on tobacco use behavior and health among the U.S. household population of adults age 18 and older and youth ages 12 to 17. On an annual basis, the PATH Study conducts interviews with and collects biospecimens from adults and youth to help inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of tobacco-product regulations by FDA in meeting its mission under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA) to regulate tobacco products, including tobacco-product advertising, labeling, marketing, constituents, ingredients, and additives. The longitudinal design of the PATH Study provides it with the capacity to measure and report within-person changes and between-person differences in tobacco product use behaviors and health effects within the cohort over time. These data will help to inform regulatory decisions and actions by FDA <PRTPAGE P="22291"/>and FDA's evaluations of associations between its regulations and tobacco use behaviors and health indicators in the population.</P>
        <P>OMB approval is requested for 3 years. There are no costs to respondents other than their time. The total estimated annualized burden hours are 105,079.</P>

        <P>HUD's CAIVRS database includes delinquent debt information from the Departments of Veteran's Affairs (VA), Education, Justice (DOJ), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). This data match will allow the prescreening of applicants for federal direct loans or federally guaranteed loans, for the purpose of determining the applicant's credit worthiness, by ascertaining whether the applicant is delinquent or in default on a loan owed directly to, or federally guaranteed by, the Federal government. Lending Federal agencies and authorized private lending institution will be able to use the CAIVRS debtor file to verify that the loan applicant is not in default, or delinquent on a Federal direct or federally guaranteed loan, prior to granting the applicant a loan. The CAIVRS database contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contributed by participating Federal agencies, including Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and other records of borrowers delinquent or in default on debts owed to, or guaranteed by HUD and other Federal agencies. Authorized users may not deny, terminate, or make a final decision concerning any loan assistance to an applicant or take other adverse action against such applicant based on the information produced by data matches conducted under CAIVRS, until such authorized users have independently verified such adverse information.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Objectives To Be Met by the Matching Program</HD>
        <P>The objective of this matching program is to give program agencies access to a system that allows them to prescreen applicants for loans made, or loans guaranteed, by the Federal Government to ascertain if the applicant is delinquent in paying a debt owed to or guaranteed by the Federal Government. As part of this process, HUD will be provided access to VA's debtor data for prescreening purposes.</P>
        <P>The use of CAIVRS will allow HUD to better monitor its credit programs and to reduce the credit extended to individuals with outstanding delinquencies on debts owed to HUD and other Federal agencies. VA expects to achieve savings through risk reduction and debt recovery. By the very nature of debt prevention, expected savings must be the subject of some assumptions, including the anticipated behavior of the matching subjects.VA also participates in CAIVRS as a cooperative effort in a governmentwide credit plan that may benefit other agencies as much, if not more, than VA.</P>

        <P>Under this computer matching program, HUD/CAIVRS receives limited information on borrowers who have defaulted on loans administered by participating Federal agencies each month. The information includes: Borrower ID Number—The Social Security Number (SSN), Employer Identification Number (EIN) or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the <PRTPAGE P="22293"/>borrower on a delinquent or defaulted federal direct loan or federally-guaranteed loan. Federal agency personnel and authorized lenders must enter a user authorization code followed by either a SSN or EIN to access CAIVRS. Only the following information is returned or displayed:</P>
        <P>• Yes/No as to whether the holder of that SSN/EIN is in default on a Federal loan; and</P>
        <P>• If Yes, then CAIVRS provides to the lender:</P>
        <P>○ Loan case number;</P>
        <P>○ Record type (claim, default, foreclosure, or judgment);</P>
        <P>○ Agency administering the loan program;</P>
        <P>○ Phone number at the applicable Federal agency (to call to clear up the default); and</P>
        <P>○ Confirmation Code associated with the query.</P>

        <P>Federal law mandates the suspension of the processing of applications for Federal credit benefits (such as government-insured loans) if the applicants are delinquent on Federal or Federally-guaranteed debt. Processing may continue only after the borrower satisfactorily resolves the debt (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> pays in full or renegotiates a new payment plan). To remove a CAIVRS sanction, the borrower must contact the Federal agency that reported their SSN or EIN to HUD/CAIVRS using the information provided.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Records To Be Matched</HD>
        <P>HUD will use records from the Single Family Default Monitoring System (SFDMS/F42D) (72 FR 65350, November 20, 2007, and Single Family Insurance System—Claims Subsystem, CLAIMS, A43C (79 FR 10825, February 26, 2014), as combined in CAIVRS to provide an up-to-date dataset to be used in records matching. SFDMS maintains data on mortgages that are 90 or more days delinquent. The Mortgagee or Servicer must submit a Monthly Delinquent Loan Report (HUD-92068-A) to HUD on a monthly basis until the mortgage status has been completed by all Mortgagees, or is otherwise terminated or deleted. Mortgagees and Servicers provide default data to HUD via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or using the Internet via FHA Connection, through which the data is sorted, pre-screened, key entered, edited, and otherwise processed. Reports are generated for HUD Headquarters and Field Offices to review.</P>
        <P>CLAIMS provides automated receipt, tracking and processing of form HUD-27011, Single Family Application for Insurance Benefits. CLAIMS provides online update and inquiry capability to Single Family Insurance and Claims databases, and to cumulative history files. Claims payments are made by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) via an HDS platform (IBM mainframe/Treasury interface) on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>For the actual data match, VA will use records from the system of records entitled “Accounts Receivable Records 88VA244.”</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Notice Procedures</HD>
        <P>HUD and VA have separate procedures for notifying individuals that their records will be matched to determine whether they are delinquent or in default on a Federal debt. HUD will notify individuals at the time of application for a HUD/FHA mortgage, and VA will notify individuals at the time of application for a VA loan services. VA may disclose information from that application to other Federal agencies under published “routine use,” without the applicants' consent, as permitted by law.</P>

        <P>HUD and VA published a notice concerning routine use disclosures in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to inform individuals that a computer match may be performed to determine a loan applicant's credit status with the Federal Government. The Privacy Act also requires that a copy of each Computer Matching Agreement entered into with a recipient agency shall be available upon request to the public.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Categories of Records/Individuals Involved</HD>
        <P>Data elements disclosed in computer matching governed by this Agreement are Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from the specified VA system of record. The data elements supplied by VA to CAIVRS are the following:</P>
        <P>• Borrower ID Number—The Social Security Number (SSN), Employer Identification.</P>
        <P>• Number (EIN) or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the borrower on a delinquent or defaulted Federal direct loan or Federally guaranteed loan.</P>
        <P>• Case Number—A reference number issued by the reporting agency for the delinquent or defaulted Federal direct loan or Federally guaranteed loan.</P>
        <P>• Agency Code—A code assigned to the reporting agency.</P>
        <P>• Type Code—A code that indicates the type of record—claim, default, foreclosure, or judgment.</P>
        <P>• Borrower ID Type—A code that indicates whether the Borrower ID Number is a SSN, EIN, or TIN.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Period of the Match</HD>

        <P>Matching will begin at least 40 days from the date that copies of the Computer Matching Agreement, signed by HUD and VA DIBs, are sent to both Houses of Congress and OMB; or at least 30 days from the date this notice is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>, whichever is later, provided that no comments that would result in a contrary determination are received. The matching program will be in effect and continue for 18 months with an option to renew for 12 additional months unless one of the Parties to the Agreement advises the other in writing to terminate or modify the Agreement.</P>

        <P>Publication of this notice allows the Department to satisfy its reporting requirement and keep an up-to-date accounting of its SORN publications. The amended SORN proposal will incorporate Federal privacy requirements and the Department's policy requirements. The Privacy Act provides individuals with certain safeguards against an invasion of their personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies to protect records contained in an agency system of records from unauthorized disclosure, by ensuring that the information collected is current and collected only for its intended use, and by providing adequate safeguards to prevent misuse of such information. In addition, this notice demonstrates the Department's focus on following industry best practices to protect the personal privacy of the individuals covered by this SORN. This SORN states the name and location of the record system, the authority for and manner of its operations, the categories of individuals that it covers, the type of records that it contains, the sources of the information for those records, the routine uses made of the records and the type of exemption in place for the records. This notice includes the business address of Department officials who will inform interested persons of the procedures whereby they may gain access to and/or request amendments to records pertaining to them.</P>
        <P>This publication does not meet the threshold requirements established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for filing a report to OMB, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as instructed by Paragraph 4c of Appendix l to OMB Circular No. A-130, “Federal Agencies Responsibilities for Maintaining Records About Individuals,” November 28, 2000. Accordingly, this notice is being revised to provide non-substantive changes that clarify text published under the prior notice location, purpose, and retention and disposal of records sections.</P>

          <P>Department of Housing and Urban Development, 470 L'Enfant Plaza East, Room 3119, Washington, DC 20026; HUD Information Technology Systems Production Data Center in South Charleston, West Virginia, and Lanham, Maryland; and at the location of the service providers under contract with HUD.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Categories of Individuals Covered by the System:</HD>
          <P>Homeowners (Mortgagors) who had Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insured loans and may be eligible for an upfront mortgage insurance premium (UFMIP) or distributive shares refund.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Categories of Records in the System:</HD>
          <P>Homeowners (Mortgagors) information is made up of the following elements: Borrower and/or co-borrower names, Social Security number (SSN), mailing address, property address, FHA case number, loan endorsement and termination dates, homeowners distributive shares refunds amount due, correspondence actions, including the number of times it was mailed to the homeowner, type of correspondence sent, and status of issued refund check.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Authority for Maintenance of the System:</HD>
          <P>The National Housing Act and Section 7(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act, section 203; Public Law 89-174; 24 CFR 5.210, 24 CFR 200.1101; 24 CFR 203.35; Debt Collection Act of 1982, Public Law 97-365; Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C § 3543, titled “Preventing fraud and abuse in Department of Housing and Urban Development programs” and enacted as part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, which permits the collection of SSN.</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Purpose(s):</HD>
          <P>The DSRS was designed in response to a Congressional mandate, wherein HUD established a new method for collecting and processing FHA UFMIP refunds or distributive share payments. The DSRS maintains records on individuals that are entitled to either two types of payments: (1) An UFMIP refund, or (2) a distributive share payment. The system is operated by the Department's Office of Single Family Insurance Operations to service unclaimed terminated loan transactions, should a homeowner terminate their mortgage insurance prior to loan maturity, entitling the homeowner to a premium refund. The DSRS records, controls, and tracks appropriations data for all terminations, disbursements, transfers, transactions, and produces daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual reports on these transactions. The system gives the Department's operating areas access to their own cash data, provides management access to all the cash data in prescribed formats, produces appropriation reports in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, 2 U.S.C. 661 et.1 seq., produces and transmits monthly cash reconciliation to the Department's accountants, and processes returned checks, check tracer actions, and related correspondence for distribution to homeowners.</P>
          <P>DSRS interfaces with the following systems to facilitate payment and refund transactions:</P>
          <P>(1) Single Family Insurance System (SFIS)—to calculate the unearned portion of the UFMIP for eligible cases, to send refund data to the DSRS for distribution of payments to the homeowner for the unearned portions of the UFMIP or distributive shares.</P>
          <P>(2) Single Family Premium Collection Subsystems (SFPCS) Upfront, and the Single Family Premium Collection Subsystems for Periodic (SFPCS-P)—to receive refund data from DSRS to generate the UFMIP refund or distributive share payments.</P>

          <P>a. Equally important, the Department utilizes the DSRS to generate correspondence actions to attempt to notify each unpaid mortgagor of their FHA insurance refund for a period of 2 years. This process occurs once the Department receives notification of a mortgage insurance termination. After this 2-year hold, the Department makes available to the general public a <PRTPAGE P="22295"/>cumulative listing of any unpaid refund that remains unpaid. The information includes the homeowner's name, last known address, FHA case number, termination data, and refund amount. This information is also made available to the public by HUD's refund database, “Does HUD Owe You a Refund?”</P>
          <HD SOURCE="HD2">Routine Uses of Records Maintained in the System, Including Categories of Users and the Purposes of Such Uses.</HD>
          <P>In addition to those disclosures generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. Section 552a(b) of the Privacy Act, all or a portion of the records or information contained in this system may be disclosed outside HUD as a routine use pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(3) as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) To authorized requesters or third party tracers who request access to UFMIP and distributive shares homeowner refund information, when such information is unavailable on HUD's FOIA reading room or refunds database Web sites. This information is releasable under FOIA. Third party release of this material may require authorized consent of the homeowner to whom the records belong, and must adhere to all HUD procedures prior to release.</P>
          <P>(2) To the U.S. Department of the Treasury for collection and disbursement of check transactions.</P>

          <P>(3) To the recorders' offices for recording legal documents and responses to offsets (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> child support) or other legal responses required during the servicing of the insured loan to allow HUD to release mortgage liens, and respond to bankruptcies or deaths of mortgagors to protect the interest of the Secretary of HUD.</P>
          <P>(4) To the Office of Inspector General to investigate possible fraud revealed in servicing homeowners refunds to allow HUD to protect the interest of the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(5) To contractors, grantees, experts, consultants and their agents, or others performing or working under a contract, service, grant, or cooperative agreement with HUD, when necessary to accomplish an agency function related to a system of records. Disclosure requirements are limited to only those data elements considered relevant to accomplishing an agency function. Individuals provided information under this routine use conditions are subject to Privacy Act requirements and disclosure limitations imposed on the Department.</P>
          <P>(6) To appropriate agencies, entities, and persons when:</P>
          <P>(a) HUD suspects or has confirmed that the security or confidentiality of information in a system of records has been compromised;</P>
          <P>(b) HUD has determined that as a result of the suspected or confirmed compromise there is a risk of harm to economic or property interests, identity theft, or fraud, or harm to the security or integrity of systems or programs (whether maintained by HUD or another agency or entity) that rely upon the compromised information; and</P>
          <P>(c) The disclosure made to such agencies, entities, and persons is reasonably necessary to assist in connection with HUD's efforts to respond to the suspected or confirmed compromise and prevent, minimize, or remedy such harm for purposes of facilitating responses and remediation efforts in the event of a data breach.</P>

          <P>(7) To appropriate agencies, entities, and persons to the extent that such disclosures are compatible with the purpose for which records in this system were collected, as set forth by Appendix I <SU>1</SU>—HUD's Library<FTREF/> of Routine Uses published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>

        <P>Tables showing Renewal Funding Inflation Factors will be available electronically from the HUD data information page at: <E T="03">http://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/rfif/FY2016/FY2016_RFIF_FMR_AREA_REPORT.pdf</E>.</P>

        <P>Division L, Title II, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 requires that the HUD Secretary, for the calendar year 2016 funding cycle, provide renewal funding for each public housing agency (PHA) based on validated voucher management system (VMS) leasing and cost data for the prior calendar year and by applying an inflation factor as established by the Secretary, by notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.  This notice provides the FY 2016 inflation factors and describes the methodology for calculating them.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Methodology</HD>
        <P>The Department has focused on measuring the change in average per unit cost (PUC) as captured in HUD's administrative data in VMS. In order to predict the likely path of PUC over time, HUD has implemented a model that uses three economic indices that capture key components of the economic climate and assist in explaining the changes in PUC. These economic components are the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate (lagged twelve months), the Consumer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the “wages and salaries” component of personal income from the National Income and Product Accounts from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This model subsequently forecasts the expected annual change in average PUC from Calendar Year (CY) 2015 to CY 2016 for the voucher program on a national basis by incorporating comparable economic variables from the Administration's economic assumptions. For reference, these economic assumptions are described in the FY 2016 Budget. The inflation factor for an individual geographic area is based on the annualized change in the area's Fair Market Rent (FMR) between FY 2014 and FY 2016. These changes in FMR are then scaled such that the voucher-weighted average of all individual area inflation factors is equal to the expected annual change in national PUC from 2015 to 2016, and also such that no area has a factor less than one. HUD subsequently applies these calculated individual area inflation factors to eligible renewal funding for each PHA based on VMS leasing and cost data for the prior calendar year. The CY 2016 PHA HCV allocation uses 0.8 percent as the annual change in PUC. This figure was calculated by using VMS data through December of 2015 and actual performance of economic indices through December of 2015.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. The Use of Inflation Factors</HD>
        <P>The inflation factors have been developed to account for relative differences in the changes of local rents so that HCV funds can be allocated among PHAs. In response to comments provided to HUD as requested in the 2015 Renewal Funding Inflation Factor notice, HUD has used the annualized change in FMRs measured between FY 2014 and FY 2016 in the apportionment of the national inflation rate to account for both the current change in rents but also the changes in rents experienced last year when the predicted inflation rate was negative. HUD anticipates that in 2017, the national inflation rate will be based on a new model of Per Unit Cost HUD is developing in response to comments that is based on independent forecasts of gross rents and tenant incomes without relying on historical values of Per Unit Cost, and will apportion this change based on the change in individual areas FMRs between FY 2016 and FY 2017.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Geographic Areas and Area Definitions</HD>

        <P>Inflation factors based on renewal funding and area FMR changes are <PRTPAGE P="22297"/>produced for all FMR areas. The tables showing the Renewal Funding Inflation Factors available electronically from the HUD data information page list the inflation factors for each FMR area and are created on a state by state basis. The inflation factors use the same OMB metropolitan area definitions, as revised by HUD, that are used in the FY 2016 FMRs. To make certain that they are referencing the correct inflation factors, PHAs should refer to the Area Definitions Table on the following Web page: <E T="03">http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/rfif/FY2016/FY2016_RFIF_FMR_AREA_REPORT.pdf</E>. The Area Definitions Table lists areas in alphabetical order by state, and the counties associated with each area. In the six New England states, the listings are for counties or parts of counties as defined by towns or cities.</P>

          <E T="03">Description of the need for the information and proposed use:</E> Pursuant to Section 1445 of the Dodd-Frank Act, all individuals providing homeownership or rental housing counseling related to HUD programs must be HUD-certified housing counselors. To become certified, a housing counselor must pass a written examination. HUD established a Housing Counselor Certification Exam and training program, as mandated by Subtitle D of title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (July 21, 2010)) (Dodd-Frank Act), and created a Web site for individuals to register for the examination and training. To track individuals using the training, successful passage of the examination, and eligibility for certification, the Web site has a registration requirement. Registration through HUD's certification contractor's Web site for the on-line training will require name, city, state, telephone number, email address, occupation, if employer is a HUD-participating housing counseling agency, and a HUD's Housing Counseling System number. Registration for the practice and certification examinations through this system will require, in addition to the information for general registration, a full mailing address, social security number, language(s) spoken by the counselor when providing counseling servicing, and optional demographic data (race, ethnicity, gender). Collection of social security numbers is required for linking the individual's information to HUD's FHA Connection system, so HUD can verify applicants are employed by participating agencies. HUD estimates the collection of this information to average five minutes for each individual that registers for the on-line training, practice examination, and certification examination. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1,700 hours per year.</P>

        <P>We announce the availability of an ITP application and HCP. Remington Stewart, LLP (applicant), requests an ITP under the Act. The applicant proposes to construct two commercial buildings with associated infrastructure (project) at the southwest corner of US-1 and Jackson Street in Sebastian, Florida, and more specifically at: Latitude 27°49′38.44″ N. and longitude −80°28′40.12″ W.</P>

        <P>Site preparation and construction will result in the permanent alteration of 2.21 acres of suitable Florida scrub-jay (<E T="03">Aphelocoma coerulescens</E>) (scrub-jay) foraging and caching habitat that is within an occupied scrub-jay territory. The applicant's HCP describes the minimization and mitigation measures proposed to address the effects of the project on the scrub jay.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Applicant's Proposed Project</HD>

        <P>We received an application from the applicant for an ITP, along with a proposed HCP. The applicant requests a 10-year permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <E T="03">et seq.</E>). The applicant proposes to construct two commercial buildings with associated infrastructure (project).</P>

        <P>Site preparation and construction will result in the permanent alteration of 2.21 acres of suitable Florida scrub-jay (<E T="03">Aphelocoma coerulescens</E>) (scrub-jay) foraging and caching habitat that is within an occupied scrub-jay territory.</P>
        <P>The applicant proposes the contribution of $126,676.56 to The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to satisfy mitigation requirements. A receipt from TNC will be provided to the Service.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Our Preliminary Determination</HD>
        <P>The Service has made a preliminary determination that the applicant's project, including the mitigation measures, will individually and cumulatively have a minor or negligible effect on the species covered in the HCP. Therefore, our proposed issuance of the requested incidental take permit qualifies as a categorical exclusion under the National Environmental Policy Act, as provided by Department of the Interior implementing regulations in part 46 of title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations (43 CFR 46.205, 46.210, and 46.215). We base our determination that issuance of the ITP qualifies as a low-effect action on the following three criteria: (1) Implementation of the project would result in minor or negligible effects on federally listed, proposed, and candidate species and their habitats; (2) Implementation of the project would result in minor or negligible effects on other environmental values or resources; and (3) Impacts of the project, considered together with the impacts of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable similarly situated projects, would not result, over time, in cumulative effects to environmental values or resources that would be considered significant. The applicants' proposed project qualifies as a “low-effect” project, as more fully explained in our environmental action statement and associated Low Effect Screening Form. This preliminary determination may be revised based on our review of public comments that we receive in response to this notice.</P>

        <P>We announce the availability of the Midwest Wind Energy Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP). Planning partners include the State conservation agencies from Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri; the American Wind Energy Association, who is representing a consortium of wind energy companies called WEBAT (Wind Energy Bat Action Team); and The Conservation Fund. The plan area encompasses all lands within the States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin. If approved, the MSHCP will authorize incidental take of the covered species that may result from wind energy development activities within covered lands over the 45-year term of the MSHCP. Covered species include the Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, little brown bat, Kirtland's warbler, interior least tern, Great Lakes and Great Plains populations of the piping plover, and the bald eagle. The activities covered under the MSHCP (“covered activities”) include the construction, operation, maintenance, decommissioning and repowering of wind energy facilities, as well as monitoring activities. Up to 18,004 megawatts (MW) of existing facilities and 33,000 MW of new wind development are proposed to be covered under the MSHCP.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, the Service is also announcing the availability of the MSHCP draft environmental impact statement (DEIS). If approved, the MSHCP will authorize incidental take of the covered species that may result from wind energy development activities within the covered lands over the 45-year term of the MSHCP. The purpose of the proposed Federal action is to allow the Service to respond to applications for incidental take permits (ITPs) under the MSHCP, which, if granted, will authorize the incidental take of covered species resulting from existing and future wind energy development within covered lands.</P>
        <P>The draft MSHCP, which has been prepared by the Service and the planning partners, covers the construction, operation, maintenance, decommissioning and reclamation, and repowering of existing and future land-based commercial wind energy facilities within covered lands, as well as monitoring activities. During the first 5 years, existing commercial wind energy projects may apply for and receive incidental take authorizations under the MSHCP; proposed commercial wind energy facilities may opt in during the first 15 years of the MSHCP. The plan area encompasses all lands under the jurisdiction of the Midwest Region of the Service, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin. The geographic area where incidental take authorization will be allowed under the MSHCP is a subset of the plan area and specifically excludes lands of particular importance to bat and migratory bird species, as well as a wide range of other wildlife species. These lands, which are referred to as covered lands in the MSHCP and the DEIS, were identified during the 2012 scoping process for the MSHCP.</P>
        <P>The draft MSHCP contains a discussion of the following: (1) Introduction; (2) Covered Activities; (3) Affected Environment and Biological Resources; (4) Take Assessment and Impact of Take; (5) Conservation Plan; (6) Alternatives to Take; (7) Monitoring, Adaptive Management, and Reporting; (8) Funding Assurances, Unforeseen and Changed Circumstances and Amendments; and (9) Plan Implementation.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>Section 9 of the ESA prohibits “take” of fish and wildlife species listed as endangered under section 4 (16 U.S.C. 1538, 1533, respectively). The ESA implementing regulations extend, under certain circumstances, the prohibition of take to threatened species (50 CFR 17.31). Under section 3 of the ESA, the term “take” means to “harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or attempt to engage in any such conduct” (16 U.S.C. 1532(19)). The term “harm” is defined by regulation as “an act which actually kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering” (50 CFR 17.3). The term “harass” is defined in the regulations as “an intentional or negligent act or omission which creates the likelihood of injury to wildlife by annoying it to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavioral patterns which include, but are not limited to, breeding, feeding, or sheltering” (50 CFR 17.3).</P>
        <P>Under section 10(a) of the ESA, the Service may issue permits to authorize incidental take of listed fish and wildlife species. “Incidental take” is defined by the ESA as take that is incidental to, and not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity. Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA contains provisions for issuing ITPs to non-Federal entities for the take of endangered and threatened species, provided the following criteria are met:</P>
        <P>• The taking will be incidental;</P>
        <P>• The applicant will, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize and mitigate the impact of such taking;</P>
        <P>• The applicant will develop an HCP and ensure that adequate funding for the plan will be provided;</P>
        <P>• The taking will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species in the wild; and</P>
        <P>• The applicant will carry out any other measures that the Secretary may require as being necessary or appropriate for the purposes of the HCP.</P>
        <P>Regulations governing permits for endangered and threatened species are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.32.</P>

        <P>Eagles are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), which prohibits take and disturbance of individuals and nests. “Take” under the Eagle Act includes any actions that pursue, shoot, shoot at, <PRTPAGE P="22301"/>poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, destroy, molest, and disturb eagles. “Disturb” is further defined in 50 CFR 22.3 as “to agitate or bother a bald or golden eagle to a degree that causes, or is likely to cause, based on the best scientific information available, (1) injury to an eagle, (2) a decrease in its productivity, by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding, or sheltering behavior, or (3) nest abandonment, by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding, or sheltering behavior.” 50 CFR 22.11 allows take authorization to be extended to permittees authorized to take eagles by an ITP issued pursuant to section 10(a)(l)(B) of the ESA. Take coverage for bald eagles provided through an ITP applies for the duration of the permit, or until the amount or level of take authorized has been met, provided the permittee complies with all terms and conditions provided in the ITP.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the States of Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Missouri, and Iowa, on behalf of all eight partner States, submitted a grant proposal to the Service under section 6 of the ESA, proposing to develop a multi-species habitat conservation plan and incidental permitting program for future wind development within the planning area. They envisioned that the MSHCP would be developed as a template HCP, meaning that the Service would issue individual ITPs to future applicants after the MSHCP was approved. They also contemplated one or more of the States would become a master permittee and issue certificates of inclusion (COI); however, at this time none of the States have agreed to serve as the master permittee. As a result, the MSHCP allows for the creation of a not-for-profit entity that would hold a master permit and issue COIs. The entity will be comprised of a five-person board. Three members of the Board will be held by representatives from wind energy companies and two members will be representatives of conservation and other interests that have experience with wind energy conservation-related issues. The MSHCP also allows for companies to seek individual ITPs.</P>

        <P>The MSHCP intends to provide conservation and recovery benefits to federally listed species while streamlining the permitting process for existing and future wind projects where take of listed species is likely to occur. While wind-generated power is a clean and renewable source of energy, wind turbines are known to cause mortality of bats and birds that are struck by or pass near the turning blades. Wildlife mortality may also result from other wind energy facility-related activities (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, construction-related activities). While individual wind energy development projects have been addressing endangered species issues by seeking their own facility ITPs under the ESA, a regional solution is desirable to allow for a coordinated conservation effort across large portions of species' ranges.</P>
        <P>The MSHCP provides a detailed conservation plan to ensure the incidental take caused by wind energy development will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the covered species on the covered lands, and provides mitigation to fully offset the impact of the taking. Further, the MSHCP provides a long-term monitoring and adaptive management strategy to ensure that the ITP terms are satisfied, and to account for changed and unforeseen circumstances.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Purpose and Need for Action</HD>
        <P>In accordance with NEPA, the Service has prepared a DEIS to analyze the impacts to the human environment that would occur if the MSHCP is approved and implemented and ITPs are issued.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed Action</HD>

        <P>Under the Proposed Action, ITPs will be issued under the MSHCP for the covered activities (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, construction, operation, maintenance, decommissioning and reclamation, and repowering of existing and future land-based commercial wind energy facilities within covered lands), as well as monitoring activities. Incidental take coverage will be provided for the covered species; impacts to other federally listed species will either be avoided through siting and best management practices, or addressed through a separate and site-specific ESA section 10(a)(1)(B) permitting process. If impacts to other federally listed species cannot be avoided, and an applicant does not obtain a separate permit for that species, an ITP under the MSHCP will not be issued. The proposed action also includes minimization, monitoring, reporting, and compensatory mitigation requirements as part of the conservation strategy for covered species. Existing wind energy facilities in covered lands (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, up to 18,004 MW) and up to 33,000 MW of new wind energy capacity will be considered for incidental take authorization under the proposed action.</P>
        <P>We invite comments and suggestions from all interested parties on the draft documents associated with the ITP application (HCP and HCP appendices), and request that comments be as specific as possible.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Alternatives Analyzed in the DEIS</HD>
        <P>The DEIS contains an analysis of four alternatives: (1) No Action (no permit issuance); (2) Proposed Action (Proposed MSHCP Alternative); (3) Reduced Permit Duration Alternative; (4) Increased Cut-In Speed Alternative. The DEIS considers the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the alternatives, including any measures under the Proposed Action alternative intended to minimize and mitigate such impacts. The DEIS also identifies additional alternatives that were considered but were eliminated from consideration as detailed in Section 2.4 of the DEIS.</P>
        <P>The Service invites comments and suggestions from all interested parties on the content of the DEIS. In particular, information and comments regarding the following topics are requested:</P>
        <P>1. The direct, indirect, or cumulative effects that implementation of any alternative could have on the human environment;</P>
        <P>2. Whether or not the impact on various aspects of the human environment has been adequately analyzed; and</P>
        <P>3. Any other information pertinent to evaluating the effects of the proposed action on the human environment.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">EPA's Role in the EIS Process</HD>
        <P>The EPA is charged under section 309 of the Clean Air Act to review all Federal agencies' environmental impact statements (EISs) and to comment on the adequacy and the acceptability of the environmental impacts of proposed actions in the EISs.</P>

        <P>EPA also serves as the repository (EIS database) for EISs prepared by Federal agencies and provides notice of their availability in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>. The EIS Database provides information about EISs prepared by Federal agencies, as well as EPA's comments concerning the EISs.

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
        <P>In 1994, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898, <E T="03">Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-income Populations,</E> which outlined a mandate for Federal agencies to “make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States and its territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands.” Environmental justice is often defined as meeting the needs of underserved communities by reducing disparate environmental burdens, removing barriers to participation in decision making, and increasing access to environmental benefits that help make all communities safe, vibrant, and healthy places to live and work.</P>

        <P>In August 2011, the Department joined with other Federal agencies in the signing of a <E T="03">Memorandum of Understanding on Environmental Justice and Executive Order 12898</E> (MOU). This MOU reaffirmed the Federal government's commitment to environmental justice. Provisions of the MOU call on each Federal agency to review and update existing environmental justice strategic plans where applicable and as appropriate. At that time, the Department published a 2012-2017 Environmental Strategic Plan to meet this provision to update Federal agency strategic plans.</P>
        <P>The Department's 2012-2017 Environmental Justice Strategic Plan set forth five major goals that continue to guide the Department in its pursuit of environmental justice:</P>
        <P>(1) Ensure responsible officials are aware of the provisions of EO 12898 and are able to identify and amend programs, policies, and activities under their purview that may have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority, low-income, or tribal populations;</P>
        <P>(2) Ensure minority, low-income, and tribal populations are provided with the opportunity to engage in meaningful involvement in the Department's decision making processes;</P>
        <P>(3) The Department will, on its own or in collaboration with partners, identify and address environmental impacts that may result in disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority, low-income, or tribal populations;</P>
        <P>(4) Use existing grant programs, training, and educational opportunities as available to aid and empower minority, low-income, and tribal populations in their efforts to build and sustain environmentally and economically sound communities; and</P>
        <P>(5) Integrate the Department's environmental justice strategies with its Title VI of the Civil Rights Act enforcement responsibilities to improve efficiencies while preserving the integrity of Title VI and environmental justice activities.</P>
        <P>In 2015, the Department began the process to update the Department's 2012-2017 Environmental Justice Strategic Plan by evaluating actions the Department could implement to meet the five goals. The update to the strategic plan is based on input and review by the Department's bureaus and offices and meets the goal of the 2011 MOU to periodically evaluate and update strategic plans.</P>

        <P>The BLM Proposed RMP/Final EIS for Western Oregon encompasses approximately 2.5 million acres of BLM-administered lands and 69,000 acres of split-estate lands in western Oregon. The Proposed RMP/Final EIS analyzes in detail a range of alternatives to meet the purposes and needs of: producing a sustained yield of timber products, furthering the recovery of threatened and endangered species, providing for clean water, restoring fire-adapted ecosystems, providing for recreation opportunities, and coordinating management of lands surrounding the Coquille Forest with the Coquille Tribe. The Proposed RMP would revise the RMPs for the Coos Bay, Eugene, Medford, Roseburg, and Salem District Offices and the Lakeview District's Klamath Falls Field Office. The current RMPs for these six offices were completed in 1995 and incorporate the land use allocations and standards and guidelines from the Northwest Forest Plan.</P>
        <P>In 2012, the BLM conducted an evaluation of the 1995 RMPs in accordance with its planning regulations and concluded that a plan revision was necessary to address changed circumstances and new information that had led to a substantial, long-term departure from the timber management outcomes predicted under the 1995 RMPs. Within the western Oregon districts, three BLM-administered areas are not included in the decision area: The Cascade Siskiyou National Monument (Medford District), the Upper Klamath Basin and Wood River Wetland (Klamath Falls Field Office), and the West Eugene Wetlands (Eugene District).</P>
        <P>BLM-administered lands in the planning area include Oregon and California Railroad (O&amp;C) lands, Coos Bay Wagon Road lands, Public Domain lands, and acquired lands. The Oregon and California Revested Lands Sustained Yield Management Act of 1937 put the O&amp;C lands under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Interior and provides the legal authority for the management of O&amp;C and Coos Bay Wagon Road lands. The lands were classified as timberlands to be managed for permanent forest production, and timber was to be sold, cut, and removed in conformity with the principle of sustained yield for the purpose of providing a permanent source of timber supply. The Act also provided for protecting watersheds, regulating stream flow, contributing to the economic stability of local communities and industries, and providing recreational facilities. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 provides the legal authority for management of Public Domain lands and acquired lands. These lands and resources are to be managed under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield.</P>
        <P>Land ownership patterns in western Oregon create unique management challenges. Generally, O&amp;C land is located in odd-numbered sections, and private land is located in even-numbered sections, creating a “checkerboard” ownership pattern. Activities on adjacent private lands have implications for management of BLM-administered lands. The BLM typically manages only a small percentage of land in any particular watershed, and in many cases, cumulative actions across all ownerships determine resource outcomes. In the Coast Range, checkerboard ownership is spread across the entire watershed. In the western Cascades, checkerboard ownership is mostly in the lower part of watersheds with blocked U.S. Forest Service ownership in the headwater areas.</P>
        <P>The Proposed RMP/Final EIS for the RMPs for Western Oregon plan revisions analyzes in detail the Proposed RMP, four action alternatives, two sub-alternatives, and the No Action alternative. The No Action alternative would continue to implement the 1995 RMPs, as written, with no change in the management actions and level of management intensity in the planning area.</P>

        <P>The BLM developed the Proposed RMP and action alternatives to represent a range of overall management approaches to respond to the purpose and need. The Proposed RMP and all action alternatives include the following land use allocations: Congressionally Reserved (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> wilderness, wild and scenic rivers), District-Designated Reserves, Late-Successional Reserve, Riparian Reserve, Harvest Land Base, and Eastside Management Area. The location and acreage of these allocations vary by alternative, including the <PRTPAGE P="22306"/>Proposed RMP, with the exception of congressionally reserved allocations that are common to all alternatives, including the Proposed RMP. Within each action alternative, the Harvest Land Base, Late-Successional Reserve, and Riparian Reserve have specific, mapped sub-allocations with differing management direction. Given the checkboard ownership patterns and the widespread distribution of the federally listed species in the planning area analyzed in this Proposed RMP/Final EIS, regional mitigation considerations are incorporated throughout the action alternatives.</P>
        <P>The two sub-alternatives modify an individual component of northern spotted owl conservation and have related effects on timber production.</P>
        <P>Alternative A has a Late-Successional Reserve larger than the No Action Alternative. The Harvest Land Base is comprised of the Uneven-Aged Timber Area and the High Intensity Timber Area. The High Intensity Timber Area includes regeneration harvest with no retention (clear cuts).</P>
        <P>Alternative B has a Late-Successional Reserve similar in size to Alternative A, though of a different spatial design. The Harvest Land Base is comprised of the Uneven-Aged Timber Area, Low Intensity Timber Area, and Moderate Intensity Timber Area. The portion of the Harvest Land Base in Uneven-Aged Timber Area is the largest of all action alternatives. The Low Intensity Timber Area and Moderate Intensity Timber Area include regeneration harvest with varying levels of retention.</P>
        <P>Sub-alternative B is identical to Alternative B, except that it includes protection of habitat within the home ranges of all northern spotted owl known and historic sites.</P>
        <P>Alternative C has the largest Harvest Land Base of any of the alternatives, including the Proposed RMP. The Harvest Land Base is comprised of the Uneven-Aged Timber Area and the High Intensity Timber Area. The High Intensity Timber Area includes regeneration harvest with no retention. Alternative C has the smallest acreage in the Riparian Reserve of all of the alternatives, including the Proposed RMP.</P>
        <P>Sub-alternative C is identical to Alternative C, except that the Late-Successional Reserve includes all stands 80 years old and older.</P>
        <P>Alternative D has the smallest Late-Successional Reserve of any of the alternatives, including the Proposed RMP. The Harvest Land Base is comprised of the Uneven-Aged Timber Area, Owl Habitat Timber Area, and Moderate Intensity Timber Area. The Owl Habitat Timber Area includes timber harvest applied in a manner that would maintain northern spotted owl habitat. The Moderate Intensity Timber Area includes regeneration harvest with retention. Alternative D has the largest acreage in the Riparian Reserve of all of the action alternatives, including the Proposed RMP.</P>
        <P>The BLM has developed the Proposed RMP as a variation on Alternative B, which the BLM identified in the Draft RMP/EIS as the preferred alternative. The Proposed RMP has a Late-Successional Reserve that is a refinement of the Late-Successional Reserve design in Alternative B. The Harvest Land Base is comprised of the Uneven-Aged Timber Area, Low Intensity Timber Area, and Moderate Intensity Timber Area, as in Alternative B. The geographic extent of the portion of the Harvest Land Base in Uneven-Aged Timber Area in the Proposed RMP is intermediate between Alternative B and Alternative C. The Proposed RMP includes a Riparian Reserve design that is intermediate among the alternatives and incorporates elements of each of the alternatives, resulting in an acreage that is higher than Alternatives B and C but lower than Alternatives A and D.</P>
        <P>The BLM would expand the existing (100-foot) National Trail Management Corridor on the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail to 1-mile wide (1/2-mile either side of centerline), and would establish a National Trail Management Corridor on the California National Historic Trail-Applegate Study Trail Route of 100-feet (50-feet either side of centerline).</P>
        <P>The BLM evaluated 51 eligible Wild and Scenic River segments as part of this RMP revision. Six segments—the Rogue River and West Fork Illinois River in the Medford District; and the Little North Santiam River, North Fork Siletz River, Sandy River, and Table Rock Fork-Molalla River in the Salem District—were found to be suitable and would be recommended for inclusion into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System under the Proposed RMP. These six segments would receive protection of tentative classification, outstandingly remarkable values, free-flowing characteristics, and water quality while being considered for designation. One segment, the Nestucca River Segment B, was determined to warrant joint study with the U.S. Forest Service before determining suitability and would receive protection of tentative classification, outstandingly remarkable values, free-flowing characteristics, and water quality until the completion of this joint study. One segment, South Yamhill River, contains no portion of the river or corridor on BLM-administered lands and was removed from further evaluation through this process. All remaining 43 evaluated eligible Wild and Scenic River segments were not found to be suitable for inclusion into the National Wild and Scenic River System and would be released from protective management under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.</P>

        <P>The land-use planning process was initiated on March 9, 2012, through a Notice of Intent published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> (77 FR 14414) notifying the public of a formal scoping period and soliciting public participation which ended on October 5, 2012. The BLM held scoping open houses in May and June 2012. The BLM used public scoping comments to help identify planning issues that directed the formulation of alternatives and framed the scope of analysis in the Draft RMP/EIS.</P>
        <P>Cooperating agencies in the preparation of this land use plan include the Environmental Protection Agency; National Marine Fisheries Service; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; U.S. Forest Service; State of Oregon; Benton County; Clackamas County; Columbia County; Coos County; Curry County; Douglas County; Klamath County; Lane County; Lincoln County; Linn County; Marion County; Multnomah County; Polk County; Tillamook County; Washington County; Yamhill County; Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians; Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde; Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians; Coquille Indian Tribe; Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians; and the Klamath Tribes. With the exception of Benton County, all listed counties have authorized the Association of O&amp;C Counties to act as the counties' agent and representative in their role as cooperating agencies in the planning process when county commissioners were otherwise absent.</P>

        <P>The BLM released the Draft RMP/EIS on April 24, 2015. The BLM conducted a series of public meetings after the release of the Draft RMP/EIS. The purpose of these meetings was to help members of the public understand the content of the Draft RMP/EIS and provide meaningful and constructive comments. The BLM held six “open-house” public meetings (one meeting per BLM District Office) and one meeting for elected officials where BLM employees could engage with stakeholders on all resources addressed in the Draft RMP/EIS. The BLM also organized nine, issue-specific meetings <PRTPAGE P="22307"/>on topics such as socio-economics, forestry, aquatics, and wildlife.</P>

        <P>The comment period for the Draft RMP/EIS closed on August 21, 2015. All comments received during the comment period are available to the public at: <E T="03">http://www.blm.gov/or/plans/rmpswesternoregon/comments.php.</E>
        </P>
        <P>Comments on the Draft RMP/EIS received from the public were considered and incorporated as appropriate into the proposed plan. Public comments resulted in formulation of the Proposed RMP, additional consideration of alternatives that were not analyzed in detail, presentation of new analysis within issues considered for forest management and socioeconomic resources, consideration of additional science, and the addition of clarifying text. No comments received significantly changed the proposed land use plan decisions.</P>

        <P>Instructions for filing a protest regarding the Proposed RMP/Final EIS may be found in the “Dear Reader” Letter of the RMPs for Western Oregon Proposed RMP/Final EIS and at 43 CFR 1610.5-2. All protests must be in writing and mailed to the appropriate address, as set forth in the <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E> section above. Emailed protests will not be accepted as valid protests unless the protesting party also provides the original letter by either regular or overnight mail postmarked by the close of the protest period. Under these conditions, the BLM will consider the emailed protest as an advance copy and it will receive full consideration. If you wish to provide the BLM with such advance notification, please direct emails to <E T="03">protest@blm.gov.</E>

        <P>
          <E T="03">Background.</E>—The final phase of these investigations is being scheduled pursuant to sections 705(b) and 731(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671d(b) and 1673d(b)), as a result of affirmative preliminary determinations by the Department of Commerce that certain benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of section 703 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1671b) are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Brazil of hot-rolled steel flat products, and that such products from Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom are being sold in the United States at LTFV within the meaning of section 733 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b). The investigations were requested in petitions filed on August 11, 2015 by AK Steel Corporation (West Chester, Ohio), ArcelorMittal USA, LLC (Chicago, Illinois), Nucor Corporation (Charlotte, North Carolina), SSAB Enterprises, LLC (Lisle, Illinois), Steel Dynamics, Inc.

        <P>The Commission instituted this investigation on January 27, 2015, based on a complaint filed on behalf of Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Complainant”) of San Jose, California. 80 FR 4314-15 (Jan. 27, 2015). The complaint was filed on December 19, 2014 and a supplement was filed on January 8, 2015. The complaint alleges violations of section 337 based upon the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain network devices, related software and components thereof by reason of infringement of certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,162,537 (“the '537 patent”); U.S. Patent No. 8,356,296 (“the '296 patent”); U.S. Patent No. 7,290,164 (“the '164 patent”); U.S. Patent No. 7,340,597 (“the '597 patent”); U.S. Patent No. 6,741,592 (“the '592 patent”); and U.S. Patent No. 7,200,145 (“the '145 patent”), and alleges that an industry in the United States exists as required by subsection (a)(2) of section 337. The '296 patent was previously terminated from the investigation. A Commission investigative attorney (“IA”) is participating in the investigation.</P>
        <P>On February 2, 2016, the ALJ issued his final ID finding a violation of section 337. The ID found a violation with respect to the '537, '592 and '145 patents. The ID found no violation for the '597 and '164 patents. On February 11, 2016, the ALJ issued his Recommended Determination on Remedy and Bonding (“RD”).</P>
        <P>On February 17, 2016, Cisco and Arista filed petitions for review. On March 3, 2016, the parties, including the IA, filed responses to the respective petitions for review.</P>

        <P>Having examined the record of this investigation, including the final ID, the petitions for review, and the responses thereto, the Commission has determined to review the final ID on the following issues: (1) Infringement of the '537, '597, '592 and '145 patents; (2) patentability of the '597, '592, and '145 patents under 35 U.S.C. 101; (3) the construction of “said router configuration data managed by said database system and derived from configuration commands supplied by a user and executed by a router configuration subsystem before being stored in said database” of claims 1, 10, and 19 of the '537 patent; (4) the construction of “a change to a configuration”/“a change in configuration” of claims 1, 39, and 71 of the '597 patent; (5) equitable estoppel; (6) laches; (7) the technical prong of domestic industry for the '537, '597, '592 and '145 patents; (8) economic prong of domestic industry; and (9) importation. To the extent any findings that the Commission is reviewing herein implicates the ID's findings for the '164 patent (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> intent to induce infringement), the Commission reviews those findings for the '164 patent.</P>
        <P>The parties are requested to brief their positions on the issues under review with reference to the applicable law and the evidentiary record. In connection with its review, the Commission is interested in only responses to the following questions. For each argument presented, the parties' submissions should set forth whether such argument was presented to the ALJ and if so include citations to the record.</P>

          <PRTPAGE P="22313"/>

          <P>1. Please provide a chart identifying for each asserted claim of the '537, '597, '592 and '145 patents: (1) The basis for Cisco's infringement allegation (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> direct infringement, contributory infringement, and/or induced infringement); (2) identification and description of each accused product [[              ]].</P>
          <P>2. If the Commission were to reverse the ID's finding [[              ]]?</P>

          <P>3. Did Arista waive its argument that it had a good-faith basis for its belief of noninfringement by failing to present the argument to the ALJ? <E T="03">See</E> Arista Pet. at 33; Cisco Reply at 36. If not, did Arista demonstrate a good-faith belief of noninfringement?</P>
          <P>4. [[              ]]?</P>
          <P>5. Can evidence of [[             ]] establish intent to indirectly infringe? Please discuss relevant case law pertaining to specific intent [[              ]].</P>
          <P>6. [[              ]].</P>
          <P>7. [[              ]].</P>

          <P>8. Please discuss the relevant case law pertaining to whether [[             ]] is “material” to establish contributory infringement for the '537, '592 and '145 patents. <E T="03">See e.g.,</E> Arista Pet. at 39-42, 67.</P>
          <P>9. Please discuss and cite any record evidence that demonstrates when Cisco came into possession of RX-2964C, CX-0479, and RX-4007C. [[              ]]?</P>
          <P>10. Please discuss whether the “materially prejudiced” requirement has been satisfied here for purposes of laches and equitable estoppel. In responding to this question, please address the prejudice demonstrated for each of the '537, '592, and '145 patents independently and discuss the relevant case law in your response.</P>

          <P>11. Please discuss whether laches should be an available defense in a Section 337 investigation. In your response, please address how <E T="03">SCA Hygiene Products</E> v. <E T="03">First Quality Baby Prod.,</E> 807 F.3d 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2015) applies and any statutory support for your position.</P>
          <P>12. Does the ID's construction of “a change to a configuration”/ “a change in configuration” in the asserted claims of the `537 patent to mean “a change to the state of the device” read out the phrase “of the subsystem” from the claims? Does this construction require that the change in state be to the subsystem or the device as a whole?</P>
          <P>13. Please discuss whether anything in the specification, prosecution history or claims limit what constitutes “changes” in the “a change to a configuration”/ “a change in configuration” limitations of the asserted claims of the '597 patent. Please also address, if the Commission were to adopt the construction proposed by Arista, what would constitute a “change”?</P>
          <P>14. Is the determination by [[              ]] that would meet the “detect a change to a configuration of said subsystem”/ “detect/[ing] a change in a configuration of a subsystem” limitations of the asserted claims of the '597 patent under the ID's construction?</P>

          <P>15. Discuss whether the accused products meet the limitations of “detect a change to a configuration of said subsystem”/ “detect/[ing] a change in a configuration of a subsystem” limitations of the asserted claims. Please address (1) the ID's construction, which requires detecting “a change to the state of the device”, and (2) a construction that requires detecting a “change to the state” of the subsystem. <E T="03">See e.g.,</E> Arista Pet. at 85.</P>

          <P>16. With respect to the public interest factors, please discuss the facts in the record pertaining to the following: (1) Whether RFC 5517 is a <E T="03">de facto</E> industry standard; (2) whether the '592 and '145 patents are essential to an industry standard; (3) whether licensing obligations apply to RFC 5517; (4) whether Cisco complied with any licensing obligations with respect to an industry standard; and (5) whether patent hold-up and/or patent hold-out have been demonstrated in the record of this investigation. <E T="03">See</E> Respondent Arista's Public Interest Submission Under 210.50(a) at 4-5 (March 17, 2016). Provide an analysis as to how these issues relate to the statutory public interest factors of Section § 337(d) and (f), 19 U.S.C. 1337(d), (f).</P>

          <P>17. For purposes of the analysis of the statutory public interest factors, describe in detail the specific course of conduct on the part of Cisco, or other factors, that would support a finding that F/RAND commitments have arisen with respect to the '592 and '145 patents here. How does the RFC 5517 document factor into the analysis since it specifically states that what is described with respect to the '592 and '145 patents is not a standard? Arista argues that Cisco “never offered Arista a chance to license this <E T="03">de facto</E> standard used by Cisco's other networking competitors.” Respondent Arista's Public Interest Submission Under 210.50(a) at 5. Describe in detail any attempts that Arista made to license the '592 and '145 patents from Cisco. Please describe Cisco's response to these attempts.</P>
        </EXTRACT>
        
        <P>In connection with the final disposition of this investigation, the Commission may (1) issue an order that could result in the exclusion of the subject articles from entry into the United States, and/or (2) issue one or more cease and desist orders that could result in the respondent(s) being required to cease and desist from engaging in unfair acts in the importation and sale of such articles. Accordingly, the Commission is interested in receiving written submissions that address the form of remedy, if any, that should be ordered. When the Commission contemplates some form of remedy, it must consider the effects of that remedy upon the public interest. The factors the Commission will consider include the effect that an exclusion order and/or cease and desist orders would have on (1) the public health and welfare, (2) competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, (3) U.S. production of articles that are like or directly competitive with those that are subject to investigation, and (4) U.S. consumers. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving written submissions that address the aforementioned public interest factors in the context of this investigation.</P>

        <P>If a party seeks exclusion of an article from entry into the United States for purposes other than entry for consumption, the party should so indicate and provide information establishing that activities involving other types of entry either are adversely affecting it or likely to do so. For background, see <E T="03">Certain Devices for Connecting Computers via Telephone Lines,</E> Inv. No. 337-TA-360, USITC Pub. No. 2843 (December 1994) (Commission Opinion).</P>

        <P>If the Commission orders some form of remedy, the U.S. Trade Representative, as delegated by the President, has 60 days to approve or disapprove the Commission's action. <E T="03">See</E> Presidential Memorandum of July 21, 2005, 70 <E T="03">FR</E> 43251 (July 26, 2005). During this period, the subject articles would be entitled to enter the United States under bond, in an amount determined by the Commission and prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving submissions concerning the amount of the bond that should be imposed if a remedy is ordered.</P>
        <P>Written Submissions: The parties to the investigation are requested to file written submissions on the issues identified in this notice. Parties to the investigation, interested government agencies, and any other interested persons are encouraged to file written submissions on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. Such submissions should address the recommended determination by the ALJ on remedy and bonding. The complainant and the IA are also requested to submit proposed remedial orders for the Commission's consideration.</P>

        <P>Complainant is also requested to state the date that the asserted patents expire and the HTSUS numbers under which the accused products are imported. Complainant is further requested to supply the names of known importers of the products at issue in this investigation. The written submissions and proposed remedial orders must be filed no later than close of business on Monday, April 25, 2016. Reply submissions must be filed no later than the close of business on Thursday, May 5, 2016. No further submissions on these issues will be permitted unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. The page limit for the parties' initial submissions is 125 pages. The parties <PRTPAGE P="22314"/>reply submissions, if any, are limited to 75 pages.</P>

        <P>Persons filing written submissions must file the original document electronically on or before the deadlines stated above and submit 8 true paper copies to the Office of the Secretary by noon the next day pursuant to section 210.4(f) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.4(f)). Submissions should refer to the investigation number (“Inv. No. 337-TA-944”) in a prominent place on the cover page and/or the first page. (<E T="03">See</E> Handbook for Electronic Filing Procedures, <E T="03">http://www.usitc.gov/secretary/fed_reg_notices/rules/handbook_on_electronic_filing.pdf</E>). Persons with questions regarding filing should contact the Secretary (202-205-2000).</P>

        <P>Any person desiring to submit a document to the Commission in confidence must request confidential treatment. All such requests should be directed to the Secretary to the Commission and must include a full statement of the reasons why the Commission should grant such treatment. <E T="03">See</E> 19 CFR 201.6. Documents for which confidential treatment by the Commission is properly sought will be treated accordingly. A redacted non-confidential version of the document must also be filed simultaneously with the any confidential filing. All non-confidential written submissions will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Secretary and on EDIS.</P>
        <P>The authority for the Commission's determination is contained in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and in Part 210 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR part 210).</P>

        <P>The DEA has considered the factors in 21 U.S.C. 823, 952(a) and 958(a) and determined that the registration of Mylan Technologies, Inc. to import the basic classes of controlled substances is consistent with the public interest and with United States obligations under international treaties, conventions, or protocols in effect on May 1, 1971. The DEA investigated the company's maintenance of effective controls against diversion by inspecting and testing the company's physical security systems, verifying the company's compliance with state and local laws, and reviewing the company's background and history.</P>
        <P>Therefore, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 952(a) and 958(a), and in accordance with 21 CFR 1301.34, the above-named company is granted registration as an importer of the following basic classes of controlled substances:</P>

The average hour burden for this specific forms is 6,000 × 5 minutes/60 = 250 hours.</P>
        <P>6. <E T="03">An estimate of the total public burden (in hours) associated with the collection:</E> The entire process of reading the letter and completing both forms would take 15 minutes per respondent.

        <P>In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (“Act”), 19 U.S.C. 2273, the Department of Labor issued a Certification of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on November 13, 2015, applicable to workers of Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc., a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Manufacturing Division, Normal, Illinois. The Department's notice of determination was published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on January 11, 2016 (81 FR 1227).</P>
        <P>At the request of MPW industrial Services, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New information from the company official shows that workers leased from MPW Industrial Services were employed on-site at the Normal, Illinois location of Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc., a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Manufacturing Division.</P>
        <P>The Department has determined that these workers were sufficiently under the operational control of Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc., a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Manufacturing Division, Normal, Illinois to be considered leased workers.</P>
        <P>The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers of the subject firm who were adversely affected by a shift in production to a foreign country of passenger automobiles or articles like or directly competitive.</P>
        <P>Based on these findings, the Department is amending this certification to include workers leased from MPW Industrial Services working on-site at the Normal, Illinois location of the subject firm.</P>
        <P>The amended notice applicable to TA-W-91,030 is hereby issued as follows:</P>
        
        <EXTRACT>
          <P>All workers from Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc., a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation, Manufacturing Division, including on-site leased workers from ETG, HRU Technical Resources, Kelly Temporary Services, Randstad Technologies(formerly Technisource), STL Commercial Staffing (formerly Firstaff), and MPW Industrial Services, Normal, Illinois who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after October 6, 2014 through November 13, 2017, and all workers in the group threatened with total or partial separation from employment on date of certification through two years from the date of certification, are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Notice of Final Decision</HD>
        <P>OSHA hereby gives notice of the expansion of the scope of recognition of TUV SUD America Inc. (TUVAM) as an NRTL. TUVAM's expansion covers the addition of one test standard to its scope of recognition.</P>

        <P>OSHA recognition of an NRTL signifies that the organization meets the requirements specified by 29 CFR 1910.7. Recognition is an <PRTPAGE P="22320"/>acknowledgment that the organization can perform independent safety testing and certification of the specific products covered within its scope of recognition and is not a delegation or grant of government authority. As a result of recognition, employers may use products properly approved by the NRTL to meet OSHA standards that require testing and certification of the products.</P>

        <P>The Agency processes applications by an NRTL for initial recognition, or for expansion or renewal of this recognition, following requirements in Appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.7. This appendix requires that the Agency publish two notices in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in processing an application. In the first notice, OSHA announces the application and provides its preliminary finding and, in the second notice, the Agency provides its final decision on the application. These notices set forth the NRTL's scope of recognition or modifications of that scope. OSHA maintains an informational Web page for each NRTL that details its scope of recognition. These pages are available from the Agency's Web site at <E T="03">http://www.osha.gov/dts/otpca/nrtl/index.html.</E>
        </P>
        <P>TUVAM submitted an application, dated August 10, 2015 (OSHA-2007-0043-0018) to expand its recognition to include one additional test standard. OSHA staff performed a comparability analysis and reviewed other pertinent information. OSHA did not perform any on-site reviews in relation to this application.</P>

        <P>OSHA published the preliminary notice announcing TUVAM's expansion application in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on January 22, 2016 (81 FR 3833). The Agency requested comments by February 8, 2016, but it received no comments in response to this notice. OSHA now is proceeding with this final notice to grant expansion of TUVAM's scope of recognition.</P>

        <P>To obtain or review copies of all public documents pertaining to TUVAM's application, go to <E T="03">www.regulations.gov</E> or contact the Docket Office, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Room N-2625, Washington, DC 20210. Docket No. OSHA-2007-0043 contains all materials in the record concerning TUVAM's recognition.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Final Decision and Order</HD>
        <P>OSHA staff examined TUVAM's expansion application, its capability to meet the requirements of the test standards, and other pertinent information. Based on its review of this evidence, OSHA finds that TUVAM meets the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 for expansion of its recognition, subject to the limitation and conditions listed below. OSHA, therefore, is proceeding with this final notice to grant TUVAM's scope of recognition. OSHA limits the expansion of TUVAM's recognition to testing and certification of products for demonstration of conformance to the test standard listed in Table 1 below.</P>

        <P>OSHA's recognition of any NRTL for a particular test standard is limited to equipment or materials for which OSHA standards require third-party testing and certification before using them in the workplace. Consequently, if a test standard also covers any products for which OSHA does not require such testing and certification, an NRTL's scope of recognition does not include these products.</P>
        <P>The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) may approve the test standard listed above as an American National Standard. However, for convenience, we may use the designation of the standards-developing organization for the standard as opposed to the ANSI designation. Under the NRTL Program's policy (see OSHA Instruction CPL 1-0.3, Appendix C, paragraph XIV), any NRTL recognized for a particular test standard may use either the proprietary version of the test standard or the ANSI version of that standard. Contact ANSI to determine whether a test standard is currently ANSI-approved.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Conditions</HD>
        <P>In addition to those conditions already required by 29 CFR 1910.7, TUVAM must abide by the following conditions of the recognition:</P>
        <P>1. TUVAM must inform OSHA as soon as possible, in writing, of any change of ownership, facilities, or key personnel, and of any major change in its operations as an NRTL, and provide details of the change(s);</P>
        <P>2. TUVAM must meet all the terms of its recognition and comply with all OSHA policies pertaining to this recognition; and</P>
        <P>3. TUVAM must continue to meet the requirements for recognition, including all previously published conditions on TUVAM's scope of recognition, in all areas for which it has recognition.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to the authority in 29 CFR 1910.7, OSHA hereby expands the scope of recognition of TUVAM, subject to the limitation and conditions specified above.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below.

          <FTREF/> The Rule was incorrectly numbered in the initial proposed rule change as the last rule within Chapter XI of the Exchange's rulebook is Rule 11.20, Obligations of Market Makers. The Exchange now propose to renumber it as Rule 11.21 in order to have consecutively numbered rules within Chapter XI of its rulebook. Other than renumbering the rule as proposed herein, the Exchange does not proposes to amend any of the provisions of current Rule 11.27.</P>

The Commission, pursuant to its authority under Rule 608(e) of Regulation NMS, granted the Exchange a limited exemption from the requirement to comply with certain provisions of the Plan as specified in the letter and noted herein. <E T="03">See</E> letter from David Shillman, Associate Director, Division of Trading and Markets, Commission to Eric Swanson, General Counsel, Exchange, dated March 22, 2016 (“Exemption Letter”).

        <P>The Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act <SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/> in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act <SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/> in particular, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. The Exchange believes that this proposal is consistent with the Act because it ensures consecutively numbered rules within Chapter XI of its rulebook, thereby clarifying the Exchange's rulebook and avoiding potential investor confusion.</P>

        <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange notes that the proposed rule change is not intended to have a competitive impact.

        <P>A proposed rule change filed pursuant to Rule 19b-4(f)(6) under the Act <SU>11</SU>

          <FTREF/> permits the Commission to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay. The Exchange has stated that the proposed rule change is intended to ensure consecutively numbered rules within Chapter XI of the Exchange's rulebook and does not amend any of the provisions of current Rule 11.27. The Commission believes that waiver of the operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because it may benefit investors by clarifying the Exchange's rulebook and avoiding potential investor confusion. Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the operative delay and designates the proposed rule change operative upon filing.<SU>13</SU>

        <P>Tier 1 does not currently pay a QCC rebate between 0 and 299,999 contracts in a month. The Exchange will continue to pay no rebate for Tier 1, however the Exchange proposes to lower the volume threshold to between 0 and 99,999 contracts in month. The Exchange proposes a new Tier 2 QCC rebate which would pay a QCC rebate of $0.05 <PRTPAGE P="22326"/>per contract for volume between 100,000 and 299,999 contracts in a month. The remainder of the QCC rebate tiers would be renumbered. Current Tier 2 would be renumbered as Tier 3 and would continue to pay a rebate of $0.07 per contract for volume between 300,000 and 499,999 contracts in a month. Current Tier 3 would be renumbered to Tier 4 and would continue to pay a QCC rebate of $0.08 per contract for volume between 500,000 and 699,999. Current Tier 4 would be renumbered as Tier 5 and would continue to pay a $0.09 per contract rebate for volume between 700,000 and 999,999 contracts in a month. Finally, current Tier 5 would be renumbered as Tier 6 and would continue to pay a QCC rebate of $0.11 per contract for volume over 1,000,000 contracts in a month.</P>

The Exchange believes that paying a QCC rebate starting at 100,000 contracts per month will attract additional QCC volume on the Exchange. While the other rebate tiers are not being amended and simply renumbered (current Tiers 2-6), the Exchange believes these rebate tiers will continue to attract QCC volume on the Exchange.</P>
        <P>The Exchange believes that adding a new QCC rebate tier and amending the current rebate tiers to lower the Tier 1 volume threshold and start paying a rebate of $0.05 per contract for volume between 100,000 to 299,999 contracts per month is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because all market participants are eligible to transact QCC Orders and receive the rebates.</P>

          <FTREF/> Also, Specialists and Market Makers pay a Marketing Fee <SU>20</SU>
          <FTREF/> on electronic orders but do not pay a Marketing Fee when transacting non-electronic orders, which is why the floor transaction charges are higher as compared to electronic options transaction charges for Specialists and Market Makers.</P>

        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>20</SU> The Marketing Fee is assessed on Specialists and Market Makers when they elect to participate in the Marketing program. The fees are assessed on electronically-delivered Customer orders. The fees are available to be disbursed by the Exchange according to the instructions of the Specialist or Market Maker to order flow providers who are members or member organizations who submit, as agent, Customer orders to the Exchange through a member or member organization who is acting as agent for those customer orders. Any excess funds billed but not utilized by the Specialist or Market Maker are carried forward unless the Specialist or Market Maker elects to have those funds rebated on a pro rata basis, reflected as a credit on the monthly invoices. At the end of each calendar quarter, the Exchange calculates the amount of excess funds from the previous quarter and subsequently rebates excess funds on a pro-rata basis to the applicable Specialist or Market Maker who paid into that pool of funds. <E T="03">See</E> Section II of the Pricing Schedule.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange's proposal to amend its Floor Options Transaction Charges to increase Penny Options and non-Penny Pilot Options Transaction Charges for Specialists and Market Makers is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because Specialists and Market Makers have a time and place advantage on the trading floor with respect to orders, unlike other market participants. A Professional, Broker-Dealer, or a Firm would necessarily require a floor broker to represent their trading interest on the trading floor as compared to a Specialist or Market Maker that could directly transact such orders on the trading floor. Further, the Exchange believes that to attract orders from a Professional, Broker-Dealer or a Firm, via a floor broker, the rates must be competitive with rates at other trading floors.</P>

        <P>Therefore, the Exchange would continue to assess a Professional, <PRTPAGE P="22327"/>Broker-Dealer and a Firm a Floor Options Transaction Charge for Penny Pilot Options and Non-Penny Pilot Options of $0.25 per contract. Customers are not assessed an Options Transaction Charge because Customer order flow is unique. Customer liquidity benefits all market participants by providing more trading opportunities, which attracts Specialists and Market Makers. An increase in the activity of these market participants in turn facilitates tighter spreads, which may cause an additional corresponding increase in order flow from other market participants.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. <E T="03">Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</E>
        </HD>
        <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. In terms of inter-market competition, the Exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily favor competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue to be excessive, or rebate opportunities available at other venues to be more favorable. In such an environment, the Exchange must continually adjust its fees to remain competitive with other exchanges and with alternative trading systems that have been exempted from compliance with the statutory standards applicable to exchanges. Because competitors are free to modify their own fees in response, and because market participants may readily adjust their order routing practices, the Exchange believes that the degree to which fee changes in this market may impose any burden on competition is extremely limited.</P>
        <P>In this instance, the proposed changes to the charges assessed and credits available to member firms for execution of securities in securities of all three Tapes do not impose a burden on competition because the Exchange's execution services are completely voluntary and subject to extensive competition both from other exchanges and from off-exchange venues.</P>
        <P>The Exchange believes that its proposed amendments to the QCC rebate tiers and increase to the Specialist and Market Maker floor options transaction charges do not impose an undue burden on inter-market competition because the QCC rebates and Specialist and Market Maker fees remain competitive with rebates and fees offered on other options markets.<SU>21</SU>
          <FTREF/> In sum, if the changes proposed herein are unattractive to market participants, it is likely that the Exchange will lose market share as a result. Accordingly, the Exchange does not believe that the proposed changes will impair the ability of members or competing order execution venues to maintain their competitive standing in the financial markets.</P>

        <P>The Exchange's proposal to amend its Floor Options Transaction Charges to increase Penny Options and non-Penny Pilot Options Transaction Charges for Specialists and Market Makers does not impose an undue burden on intra-market competition because Specialists and Market Makers have a time and place advantage on the trading floor with respect to orders, unlike other market participants.

        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend BOX Rule 100(a)(50) relating to Professionals.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change would provide additional clarity in the BOX Rules.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Background</HD>
        <P>In general, “public customers” are granted certain marketplace advantages over other market participants, including Market Makers, brokers and dealers of securities, and industry “Professionals” on most U.S. options exchanges. The U.S. options exchanges, including BOX, have adopted similar definitions of the term “Professional,” <SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/> which commonly refers to persons or entities that are not a brokers or dealers in securities and who or which place more than 390 orders in listed options per day on average during a calendar month for their own beneficial account(s).<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/> Various exchanges adopted similar Professional rules for many of the same reasons, including, but not limited to the desire to create more competitive marketplaces and attract retail order flow.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/> In addition, as several of the exchanges noted in their original Professional rule filings, their beliefs that disparate Professional rules and a lack of uniformity in the application of such rules across the options markets would not promote the best regulation and could, in fact, encourage regulatory arbitrage.<SU>7</SU>

          <FTREF/> Specifically, Public Customer orders are <PRTPAGE P="22329"/>generally exempt from transaction fees and certain Exchange surcharges.

        <P>Currently, BOX Rule 100(a)(50) defines a Professional as “any person or entity that (i) is not a broker or dealer in securities, and (ii) places more than 390 orders in listed options per day on average during a calendar month for its own beneficial account(s).” The Exchange's Professional order rule was adopted to distinguish non-broker dealer individuals and entities that have access to information and technology that enable them to professionally trade listed options in a manner similar to brokers or dealers in securities from retail investors for order priority and/or transaction fees purposes. In general, Professionals are treated as brokers or dealers in securities under the Exchange's rules, including, but not limited to with respect to order priority and fees.<SU>10</SU>
          <FTREF/> BOX Rule 100(a)(50) is substantially similar to the Professional order rules of other exchanges and was materially based upon the preexistent Professional order rules of other exchanges.</P>

        <P>In September 2015, the Exchange clarified its Professional order rule by distributing a Regulatory Circular to its Participants.<SU>11</SU>
          <FTREF/> Specifically, the Exchange codified its interpretation that, for Professional order counting purposes, “parent” orders that are placed on a single ticket and entered for the beneficial account(s) of a person or entity that is not a broker or dealer in securities and that are broken into multiple parts by a broker or dealer, or by an algorithm housed at a broker or dealer, or by an algorithm licensed from a broker or dealer that is housed with the customer in order to achieve a specific execution strategy, should count as one single order for Professional order counting purposes. This interpretation was a clarification in the Rules based on the Exchange's past interpretations of Rule 100 (a)(50) and similar interpretations set forth in a previously issued ISE/ISE Gemini, LLC (“Gemini”) Joint Regulatory Information Circular.<SU>12</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange's Informational Circular, however, has not clarified the Exchange's Professional rule completely. The advent of new multi-leg spread products and the proliferation of the use of complex orders and algorithmic execution strategies by both institutional and retail market participants continue to raise questions as to what constitutes an “order” for Professional order counting purposes. For example, do complex orders (which on the Exchange may be up to 4 legs) constitute a single order or multiple orders for Professional order counting purposes? The Exchange's Professional rule does not fully address these issues and there is no common interpretation across the U.S. options markets.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change would serve to accomplish the Exchange's stated goals for its Professional rule. Under current Rule 100(a)(50) many market participants using sophisticated execution strategies and trading algorithms who would typically be considered professional traders are not identified under the Exchange's Professional rule. The Exchange believes that these types of market participants have access to technology and market information akin to broker-dealers. The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule is warranted to ensure that Public Customers are afforded the marketplace advantages that they are intended to be afforded over other types of market participants on the Exchange.</P>
        <P>The Exchange notes that despite the adoption of materially similar Professional rules across the markets, exchanges' interpretations of their respective Professional rules vary. Although Professionals are similarly defined by exchanges as non-broker-dealer persons or entities that place more than 390 orders in listed options for their own beneficial account(s) per day on average during a calendar month, there is no consistent definition across the markets as to what constitutes an “order” for Professional order counting purposes. While several options exchanges, including BOX, have attempted to clarify their interpretations of their Professional rules through regulatory and information notices and circulars,<SU>13</SU>
          <FTREF/> many of the options exchanges have not issued any guidance regarding the application of their Professional rules. Furthermore, where exchanges have issued such interpretive guidance, those interpretations have not necessarily been consistent.<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/> As a result, the Exchange believes that the rather than helping to promote the best regulation and discourage regulatory arbitrage, the Professional rules have become a basis of intermarket competition.</P>

        <P>The Exchange believes that a new set of standards and a more detailed counting regime than the Exchange's current Professional order rules provide would allow the Exchange to better compete for order flow and help ensure deeper levels of liquidity on the Exchange. The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change would help to remove impediments to and help perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by increasing competition in the marketplace. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to amend the Rules by amending BOX Rule 100(a)(50) to adopt new rules with respect to Professional order counting.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Proposal</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to add additional details to Rule 100(a)(50) setting forth a more in depth counting regime for calculating average daily orders for Professional order designation purposes. Specifically, the Exchange's proposed rule would make clear how to count complex orders, “parent/child” orders that are broken into multiple orders, and “cancel/replace” orders for Professional order counting purposes.</P>
        <P>Under the Exchange's proposed rule change all orders would count as one single order for Professional counting purposes, unless otherwise specified under the Rules. Proposed Rule 100(a)(50) would provide that except as noted below, each order of any order type counts as one order for Professional order counting purposes. Paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50) would discuss Complex Orders.<SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/> Under <PRTPAGE P="22330"/>paragraph (a)(1) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50), a complex order comprised of eight (8) legs or fewer would count as a single order. Conversely, paragraph (a)(2) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50) would provide that a complex order comprised of nine (9) legs or more counts as multiple orders with each option leg counting as its own separate order.<SU>16</SU>
          <FTREF/> The Exchange believes the distinction between complex orders with up to eight legs from those with nine or more legs is appropriate in light of the purposes for which Rule 100(a)(50) was adopted. In particular, the Exchange notes that multi-leg complex order strategies with nine or more legs are more complex in nature and thus, more likely to be used by professional traders than traditional two, three, and four leg complex order strategies such as the strangle, straddle, butterfly, collar, and condor strategies, and combinations thereof with eight legs or fewer, which are generally not algorithmically generated and are frequently used by retail investors. Thus, the types of complex orders traditionally placed by retail investors would continue to count as only one order while the more complex strategy orders that are typically used by professional traders would count as multiple orders for Professional order counting purposes.</P>

            <SU>15</SU> A Complex Order is defined as any order involving the simultaneous purchase and/or sale of two or more different options series in the same underlying security, for the same account, in a ratio that is equal to or greater than one-to-three (.333) and less than or equal to three-to-one (3.00) and for <PRTPAGE/>the purpose of executing a particular investment strategy. <E T="03">See</E> BOX Rule 7240(a)(5).</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>Paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50) would provide details relating to the counting of “parent/child” orders. Under paragraph (b)(1), a “parent” order that is placed for the beneficial account(s) of a person or entity that is not a broker or dealer in securities that is broken into multiple “child” orders on the same side (buy/sell) and series as the “parent” order by a broker or dealer, or by an algorithm housed at a broker or dealer or by an algorithm licensed from a broker or dealer, but which is housed with the Public Customer, counts as one order even if the “child” orders are routed across multiple exchanges. Essentially, this paragraph would describe how orders placed for Public Customers, which are “worked” by a broker in order to receive best execution should be counted for Professional order counting purposes. Paragraph (b)(1) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50) would permit larger “parent” orders (which may be simple orders or complex orders consisting of up to eight legs), to be broken into multiple smaller orders on the same side (buy/sell) and in the same series (or complex orders consisting of up to eight legs) in order to attempt to achieve best execution for the overall order.</P>
        <P>For example, if a Public Customer were to enter an order to buy 1,000 XYZ $5 January calls at a limit price of $1, which the Public Customer's broker then broke into four separate orders to buy 250 XYZ $5 January calls at a limit price of $1 in order to achieve a better execution, the four “child” orders would still only count as one order for Professional order counting purposes (whether or not the four separate orders were sent to the same or different exchanges for execution).<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/> Similarly, in the case of a complex order, if a Public Customer were to enter an order to buy 1,000 XYZ $5 January(sell)/March(buy) calendar spreads (with a 1:1 ratio on the legs), at a net debit limit price of $0.20, which the Public Customer's broker then broke into four separate orders to buy 250 XYZ $5 January/March calendar spreads (each with a 1:1 ratio on the legs), each at a net debit limit price of $0.20, the four “child” orders would still only count as one order for Professional order counting purposes (whether or not the four separate orders were sent to the same or different exchanges for execution).</P>

            <SU>17</SU> Notably, however, if the customer herself were to enter the same four identical orders to buy 250 XYZ $5 January calls at a limit price of $1 prior to sending the orders, those orders would count as four separate orders for Professional order counting purposes because the orders would not have been broken into multiple “child” orders on the same side (buy/sell) and series as the “parent” order by a broker or dealer, or by an algorithm housed at a broker or dealer or by an algorithm licensed from a broker or dealer, but which is housed with the customer.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Conversely, under paragraph (b)(2) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50), a “parent” order (including a strategy order) <SU>18</SU>
          <FTREF/> that is broken into multiple “child” orders on both sides (buy/sell) of a series and/or multiple series counts as multiple orders, with each “child” order counting as a new and separate order. Accordingly, under this provision, strategy orders, which are most often used by sophisticated traders best characterized as “Professionals,” would count as multiple orders for each child order entered as part of the overall strategy. For example, if a customer were to enter an order with her broker by which multiple “child” orders were then sent to the Exchange across multiple series in a particular option class, each order entered would count as a separate order for Professional order counting purposes. Likewise, if the Public Customer instructed her broker to buy a variety of calls across various option classes as part of a basket trade, each order entered by the broker in order to obtain the positions making up the basket would count as a separate order for Professional counting purposes.<SU>19</SU>
          <FTREF/>
        </P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>18</SU> For purposes of this proposed Rule 100(a)(50), the term “strategy order” is intended to mean an execution strategy, trading instruction, or algorithm whereby multiple “child” orders on both sides of a series and/or multiple series are generated prior to being sent to any or multiple U.S. options exchange(s).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>19</SU> Notably, with respect to the types of “parent” orders (including strategy orders) described in paragraph (b)(2) to proposed Rule 100(a)(50), such orders would be received only as multiple “child” orders the U.S. options exchange receiving such orders. The “parent” order would be broken apart before being sent by the participant to the exchange(s) as multiple “child” orders.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the distinctions between “parent” and “child” orders in paragraph (b) to proposed Rule 100(a)(50) are appropriate. The Exchange notes that paragraph (b) to proposed Rule 100(a)(50) is not aimed at capturing orders that are being “worked” or broken into multiple orders to avoid showing large orders to the market in an effort to elude front-running and to achieve best execution as is typically done by brokers on behalf of retail clients. Rather, paragraph (b) to proposed Rule 100(a)(50) is aimed at identifying “child” orders of “parent” orders generated by algorithms that are typically used by sophisticated traders to continuously update their orders in concert with market updates in order to keep their overall trading strategies in balance. The Exchange believes that these types of “parent/child” orders typically used by sophisticated traders should count as multiple orders.</P>

        <P>Paragraph (c) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50), would discuss the counting of orders that are cancelled and replaced. Similar to the distinctions drawn in paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50), paragraph (c) would essentially separate orders that are cancelled and replaced as part of an overall strategy from those that are cancelled and replaced by a broker that is “working” the order to achieve best execution or attempting to time the market. Specifically, paragraph (c)(1) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50) would provide that except as otherwise provided in the rule (and specifically as provided under paragraph (c)(2)), any order that cancels and replaces an existing order counts as a separate order (or multiple new orders in the case of a complex order comprised of nine (9) legs or more). For example, if a trader were to enter a non-marketable limit order to buy an option contract at a certain net debit price, cancel the order in response to market <PRTPAGE P="22331"/>movements, and then reenter the same order once it became marketable, those orders would count as two separate orders for Professional order counting purposes even though the terms of both orders were the same.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (c)(2) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50) would specify the exception to paragraph (c)(1) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50) and would provide that an order that cancels and replaces any “child” order resulting from a “parent” order that is placed for the beneficial account(s) of a person or entity that is not a broker, or dealer in securities that is broken into multiple “child” orders on the same side (buy/sell) and series as the “parent” order by a broker or dealer, by an algorithm housed at a broker or dealer, or by an algorithm licensed from a broker or dealer, but which is housed with the Public Customer, would not count as a new order. For example, if a Public Customer were to enter an order with her broker to buy 10,000 XYZ $5 January calls at a limit price of $1, which the Public Customer's broker then entered, but could not fill and then cancelled to avoid having to rest the order in the book as part of a strategy to obtain a better execution for the Public Customer and then resubmitted the remainder of the order, which would be considered a “child” of the “parent” order, once it became marketable, such orders would only count as one order for Professional order counting purposes. Again, similar to paragraph (b) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50), the Exchange notes that paragraph (c) to proposed Rule 100(a)(50) is not aimed at capturing orders that are being “worked” or being cancelled and replaced to avoid showing large orders to the market in an effort to elude front-running and to achieve best execution as is typically done by brokers on behalf of retail clients. Rather, paragraph (c) to proposed Rule 100(a)(50) is aimed at identifying “child” orders of “parent” orders generated by algorithms that are typically used by sophisticated traders to continuously update their orders in concert with market updates in order to keep their overall trading strategies in balance. The Exchange believes that paragraph (c)(2) to proposed Rule 100(a)(50) is consistent with these goals.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50), under paragraph (c)(3) of proposed Rule 100(a)(50), an order that cancels and replaces any “child” order resulting from a “parent” order (including a strategy order) that generates “child” orders on both sides (buy/sell) of a series and/or in multiple series would count as a new order. For example, if an investor were to seek to make a trade (or series of trades) to take a long position at a certain percentage limit on a basket of options, the investor may need to cancel and replace several of the “child” orders entered to achieve the overall execution strategy several times to account for updates in the prices of the underlyings. In such a case, each “child” order placed to keep the overall execution strategy in place would count as a new and separate order even if the particular “child” order were being used to replace a slightly different “child” order that was previously being used to keep the same overall execution strategy in place. The Exchange believes that the distinctions between cancel/replace orders in paragraph (c) to proposed Rule 100(a)(50) are appropriate as such orders are typically generated by algorithms used by sophisticated traders to keep strategy orders continuously in line with updates in the markets. As such, the Exchange believes that in most cases, cancel/replace orders should count as multiple orders.</P>
        <P>Under current BOX Rule 100(a)(50), in order to properly represent orders entered on the Exchange, BOX Participants are required to indicate whether Public Customer orders are “Professional” orders. This requirement will remain the same. To comply with this requirement, Participants are required to review their customers' activity on at least a quarterly basis to determine whether orders that are not for the account of a broker or dealer should be represented as customer orders or Professional orders. Orders for any Public Customer that had an average of more than 390 orders per day during any month of a calendar quarter must be represented as Professional orders for the next calendar quarter. Participants are required to conduct a quarterly review and make any appropriate changes to the way in which they are representing orders within five days after the end of each calendar quarter. While Participants only will be required to review their accounts on a quarterly basis, if during a quarter the Exchange identifies a customer for which orders are being represented as public customer orders but that has averaged more than 390 orders per day during a month, the Exchange will notify the Participant and the Participant will be required to change the manner in which it is representing the Public Customer's orders within five days. Because BOX Rule 100(a)(50) only requires that Participants conduct a look-back to determine whether their Public Customers are averaging more than 390 orders per day at the end of each calendar quarter, the Exchange proposes an effective date of April 1, 2016 for proposed calculation details to ensure that all orders during the next quarterly review will be counted in the same manner and that proposed language will not be applied retroactively.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”),<SU>20</SU>
          <FTREF/> in general, and Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,<SU>21</SU>
          <FTREF/> in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general to protect investors and the public interest. In particular, the Exchange believes that proposed changes to Rule 100(a)(50) provides a more conservative order counting regime for Professional order counting purposes that would identify more traders as Professionals to which the Exchange's definition of Professional was designed to apply and create a better competitive balance for all participants on the Exchange, consistent with the Act. As the options markets have evolved to become more electronic and more competitive, the Exchange believes that the distinction between registered broker-dealers and professional traders who are currently treated as Public Customers has become increasingly blurred. More and more, the category of Public Customer today includes sophisticated algorithmic traders including former market makers and hedge funds that trade with a frequency resembling that of broker-dealers. The Exchange believes that it is reasonable under the Act to treat those customers who meet the high level of trading activity established in the proposal differently than customers who do not meet that threshold and are more typical retail investors to ensure that professional traders do not take advantage of priority and fee benefits intended for Public Customers.</P>

        <P>The Exchange notes that it is not unfair to differentiate between different types of investors in order to achieve certain marketplace balances. The Rules currently differentiate between Public <PRTPAGE P="22332"/>Customers, Broker-Dealers, Market Makers, and the like. These differentiations have been recognized to be consistent with the Act. The Exchange does not believe that the current BOX Rules and other exchanges that accord priority to all Public Customers over broker-dealers are unfairly discriminatory. Nor does the Exchange believe that it is unfairly discriminatory to accord priority to only those Public Customers who on average do not place more than one order per minute (390 per day) under the counting regime that the Exchange proposes. The Exchange believes that such differentiations drive competition in the marketplace and are within the business judgment of the Exchange. Accordingly, the Exchange also believes that its proposal is consistent with the requirement of Section 6(b)(8) of the Act that the rules of an exchange not impose an unnecessary or inappropriate burden upon competition in that it treats persons who should be deemed Professionals, but who may not be under current Rule 100(a)(50) in a manner so that they do not receive special priority benefits.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will protect investors and the public interest by helping to assure that retail customers continue to receive the appropriate marketplace advantages in the BOX marketplace as intended, while furthering competition among marketplace professionals by treating them in the same manner as other similarly situated market participants. The Exchange believes that it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act not to afford market participants with similar access to information and technology as that of brokers and dealers of securities with marketplace advantages over such marketplace competitors. The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change would help to remove burdens on competition and promote a more competitive marketplace by affording certain marketplace advantages only to those for whom they are intended. Finally, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change sets forth a more detailed and clear regulatory regime with respect to calculating average daily order entry for Professional order counting purposes. The Exchange believes that this additional clarity and detail will eliminate confusion among market participants, which is in the interests of all investors and the general public.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
        <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. In this regard and as indicated above, the Exchange notes that the rule change is substantially similar to a recent CBOE filing.<SU>22</SU>
          <FTREF/> As discussed above, the Exchange does not believe that the current BOX Rules and other exchanges that accord priority to all Public Customers over broker-dealers are unfairly discriminatory. Nor does the Exchange believe that it is unfairly discriminatory to accord priority to only those customers who on average do not place more than one order per minute (390 per day) under the counting regime that the Exchange proposes. The Exchange believes that its proposal does not impose an undue burden on competition. The Exchange notes that one of the purposes of the Professional rules is to help ensure fairness in the marketplace and promote competition among all market participants. The Exchange believes that proposed BOX Rule100(a)(50)(a) would help establish more competition among market participants and promote the purposes for which the Exchange's Professional rule was originally adopted. The Exchange does not believe that the Act requires it to provide the same incentives and discounts to all market participants equally, so as long as the exchange does not unfairly discriminate among participants with regard to access to exchange systems. The Exchange believes that here, that is clearly the case.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Introduction</HD>
        <P>On December 4, 2015, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission” or “SEC”) proposed rule change SR-FINRA-2015-054, pursuant to which FINRA proposed to adopt a rule set that would apply exclusively to firms that meet the definition of “capital acquisition broker” and that elect to be governed under this rule set (collectively, the “CAB Rules”).</P>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend its Fees Schedule. The text of the proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site (<E T="03">http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/CBOELegalRegulatoryHome.aspx</E>), at the Exchange's Office of the Secretary, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</HD>
        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. <E T="03">Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</E>
        </HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend its Fees Schedule, effective April 1, 2016. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to extend the current waiver of the VIX Index License Surcharge of $0.10 per contract for Clearing Trading Permit Holder Proprietary (“Firm”) (origin codes “F” or “L”) VIX orders that have a premium of $0.10 or lower and have series with an expiration of seven (7) calendar days or less. The Exchange adopted the current waiver to reduce transaction costs on expiring, low-priced VIX options, which the Exchange believed would encourage Firms to seek to close and/or roll over such positions close to expiration at low premium levels, including facilitating customers to do so, in order to free up capital and encourage additional trading. The Exchange initially proposed to waive the surcharge through March 31, 2016, at which time the Exchange stated that it would evaluate whether the wavier [sic] has in fact prompted Firms to close and roll over these positions close to expiration as intended. The Exchange believes the proposed change has in fact encouraged Firms to do so and as such, proposes to extend the waiver of the surcharge through December 2016, at which time the Exchange will reevaluate whether the wavier [sic] has continued to prompt Firms to close and roll over positions close to expiration at low premium levels. Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to delete the reference to the current waiver period of March 31, 2016 from the Fees Schedule and replace it with December 31, 2016.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Statutory Basis</HD>
        <P>The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”) and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.<SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/> Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) <SU>4</SU>

          <FTREF/> requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitation transactions in <PRTPAGE P="22335"/>securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Additionally, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/> which requires that Exchange rules provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its Trading Permit Holders and other persons using its facilities.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>The Exchange believes it's reasonable to continue to waive the VIX Index License Surcharge for Clearing Trading Permit Holder Proprietary VIX orders that have a premium of $0.10 or lower and have series with an expiration of 7 calendar days or less because the Exchange wants to continue encouraging Firms to roll and close over positions close to expiration at low premium levels. The Exchange notes that without the waiver, firms are less likely to engage in these transactions, as opposed to other VIX transactions, due to the associated transaction costs. The Exchange believes it's equitable and not unfairly discriminatory to limit the waiver to Clearing Trading Permit Holder Proprietary orders because they contribute capital to facilitate the execution of VIX customer orders with a premium of $0.10 or lower and series with an expiration of 7 calendar days or less. Finally, the Exchange believes it's reasonable, equitable and not unfairly discriminatory to provide that the surcharge will be waived through December 2016, as it gives the Exchange additional time to evaluate if the wavier [sic] is continuing to have the desired effect of encouraging these transactions.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. <E T="03">Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</E>
        </HD>
        <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose any burden on competition that are not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on intramarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because the proposed change applies to all Firms, and while the waiver only applies to Firm orders, Firms contribute capital to facilitate the execution of VIX customer orders with a premium of $0.10 or lower and series with an expiration of 7 days or less.</P>
        <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose any burden on intermarket competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because the proposed change only affects trading on CBOE. To the extent that the proposed changes make CBOE a more attractive marketplace for market participants at other exchanges, such market participants are welcome to become CBOE market participants.</P>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to list and trade the shares of the following under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600 (“Managed Fund Shares”): AdvisorShares Cornerstone Small Cap ETF. The proposed rule change is available on the Exchange's Web site at <E T="03">www.nyse.com,</E> at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.</P>

        <P>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of those statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below.

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Purpose</HD>
        <P>The Exchange proposes to list and trade shares (“Shares”) of the following under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.600, which governs the listing and trading of Managed Fund Shares:<SU>4</SU>
          <FTREF/> AdvisorShares Cornerstone Small Cap ETF (“Fund”). The Shares will be offered by AdvisorShares Trust (the “Trust”),<SU>5</SU>
          <FTREF/> an open-end management investment company.<SU>6</SU>

          <FTREF/> The investment adviser to the Fund will be AdvisorShares Investments LLC (the “Adviser”). Cornerstone Investment Partners will be the Fund's sub-adviser (“Sub-Adviser”). Foreside Fund Services, LLC (the “Distributor”) will be the principal underwriter and distributor of the <PRTPAGE P="22338"/>Fund's Shares. The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Administrator” or “Custodian”) will serve as the administrator, custodian and transfer agent for the Fund.</P>

          <P>
            <SU>4</SU> A Managed Fund Share is a security that represents an interest in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1) (“1940 Act”) organized as an open-end investment company or similar entity that invests in a portfolio of securities selected by its investment adviser consistent with its investment objectives and policies. In contrast, an open-end investment company that issues Investment Company Units, listed and traded on the Exchange under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 5.2(j)(3), seeks to provide investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield performance of a specific foreign or domestic stock index, fixed income securities index or combination thereof.</P>

          <P>

            <SU>5</SU> The Trust is registered under the 1940 Act. On January 26, 2016, the Trust filed with the Commission amendments to its registration statement on Form N-1A under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a) (“Securities Act”) and under the 1940 Act relating to the Fund (File Nos. 333-157876 and 811-22110) (“Registration Statement”). The description of the operation of the Trust and the Fund herein is based, in part, on the Registration Statement. In addition, the Commission has issued an order granting certain exemptive relief to the Trust under the 1940 Act. <E T="03">See</E> Investment Company Act Release No. 29291(May 28, 2010) (File No. 812-13677) (“Exemptive Order”).</P>

        <P>Commentary .06 to Rule 8.600 provides that, if the investment adviser to the investment company issuing Managed Fund Shares is affiliated with a broker-dealer, such investment adviser shall erect a “fire wall” between the investment adviser and the broker-dealer with respect to access to information concerning the composition and/or changes to such investment company portfolio. In addition, Commentary .06 further requires that personnel who make decisions on the open-end fund's portfolio composition must be subject to procedures designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material nonpublic information regarding the open-end fund's portfolio.<SU>7</SU>
          <FTREF/> Commentary .06 to Rule 8.600 is similar to Commentary .03(a)(i) and (iii) to NYSE Arca Equities Rule 5.2(j)(3); however, Commentary .06 in connection with the establishment of a “fire wall” between the investment adviser and the broker-dealer reflects the applicable open-end fund's portfolio, not an underlying benchmark index, as is the case with index-based funds. Neither the Adviser nor the Sub-Adviser is registered as a broker-dealer. Neither the Adviser nor the Sub-Adviser is affiliated with a broker-dealer. In the event (a) the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser becomes a registered broker-dealer or becomes newly affiliated with a broker-dealer, or (b) any new adviser or any sub-adviser is a registered broker-dealer or becomes affiliated with a broker-dealer, it will implement a fire wall with respect to its relevant personnel or its broker-dealer affiliate regarding access to information concerning the composition and/or changes to the Fund's portfolio, and will be subject to procedures designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material non-public information regarding such portfolio.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>7</SU> An investment adviser to an open-end fund is required to be registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). As a result, the Adviser and Sub-Adviser and their related personnel are subject to the provisions of Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act relating to codes of ethics. This Rule requires investment advisers to adopt a code of ethics that reflects the fiduciary nature of the relationship to clients as well as compliance with other applicable securities laws. Accordingly, procedures designed to prevent the communication and misuse of non-public information by an investment adviser must be consistent with Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act. In addition, Rule 206(4)-7 under the Advisers Act makes it unlawful for an investment adviser to provide investment advice to clients unless such investment adviser has (i) adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation, by the investment adviser and its supervised persons, of the Advisers Act and the Commission rules adopted thereunder; (ii) implemented, at a minimum, an annual review regarding the adequacy of the policies and procedures established pursuant to subparagraph (i) above and the effectiveness of their implementation; and (iii) designated an individual (who is a supervised person) responsible for administering the policies and procedures adopted under subparagraph (i) above.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD3">Principal Investments</HD>
        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the investment objective of the Fund will be to seek to provide total return through long-term capital appreciation and current income. Under normal circumstances,<SU>8</SU>
          <FTREF/> the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in common stocks of small cap companies traded on a U.S. or foreign exchange or over-the-counter (“OTC”). The Sub-Adviser generally defines a small cap company as one having a market capitalization less than the market cap of the largest company in the Russell 2000 Index (the “Index”) at the time of acquisition. In choosing securities of U.S. and foreign companies with market capitalization rankings between 1000 and 2800, the Sub-Adviser will create an investable universe of 1800 companies for the Fund similar to the components of the Index, but excluding the smallest 200 market capitalization securities in the Index. Sector weights will be constrained relative to Index sector weights and will be determined by the relative attractiveness of the specific sector. Securities will be targeted to be equally weighted within the sectors, but may shift with price movements.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>8</SU> The term “under normal circumstances” means, without limitation, the absence of extreme volatility or trading halts in the equity markets or the financial markets generally; operational issues causing dissemination of inaccurate market information; or force majeure type events such as systems failure, natural or man-made disaster, act of God, armed conflict, act of terrorism, riot or labor disruption or any similar intervening circumstance.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>According to the Registration Statement, the Sub-Adviser's investment philosophy is based on the view that the market often misprices fundamental improvements and is slow to recognize improving fundamentals, particularly in small cap stocks. The Sub-Adviser will seek to benefit from the volatility of small cap stocks by participating in upside volatility while reducing exposure to downside volatility. The Sub-Adviser generally intends to select stocks that satisfy three basic criteria: (1) Analysts have positively revised their forward looking estimates of the company's profitability and the company has generated earnings in excess of analyst expectations; (2) balance sheet strength; and (3) financial flexibility, as determined by measuring a company's ability to meet debt and capital expenditure requirements. The 1800 companies included in the investable universe will be ranked according to these criteria, and the most attractive companies will then be considered for inclusion within the strategy, subject to risk controls and the Fund's investment objective.</P>

The ETFs all will be listed and traded in the U.S. on registered exchanges. The Fund will invest in the securities of ETFs registered under the 1940 Act consistent with the requirements of Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, or any rule, regulation or order of the Commission or interpretation thereof. The Fund will only make such ETF investments in conformity with the requirements of Regulation M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”).

            <SU>11</SU> According to the Registration Statement, ADRs are U.S. dollar denominated receipts typically issued by U.S. banks and trust companies that evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign issuer. The underlying securities may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which they may be <PRTPAGE/>converted. The underlying securities are held in trust by a custodian bank or similar financial institution in the issuer's home country. Generally, ADRs in registered form are designed for use in domestic securities markets and are traded on exchanges or OTC in the U.S. GDRs, EDRs, and IDRs are similar to ADRs in that they are certificates evidencing ownership of shares of a foreign issuer; however, GDRs, EDRs, and IDRs may be issued in bearer form and denominated in other currencies, and are generally designed for use in specific or multiple securities markets outside the U.S. EDRs, for example, are designed for use in European securities markets while GDRs are designed for use throughout the world. Ordinary shares are shares of foreign issuers that are traded abroad and on a U.S. exchange. New York shares are shares that a foreign issuer has allocated for trading in the U.S. No more than 10% of the Fund's net assets will be invested in non-exchange-listed ADRs.</P>

Generally, the effect of such a transaction is that the Fund can recover all or most of the cash invested in the portfolio securities involved during the term of the reverse repurchase agreement, while the Fund will be able to keep the interest income associated with those portfolio securities. The Fund will establish a segregated account with the Trust's custodian bank in which the Fund will maintain cash, cash equivalents or other portfolio securities equal in value to the Fund's obligations in respect of reverse repurchase agreements.</P>

        <P>The Fund may invest in U.S. government securities. Securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities include the following: U.S. Treasury securities, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury and which differ only in their interest rates, maturities, and times of issuance; U.S. Treasury bills, which have initial maturities of one year or less; U.S. Treasury notes, which have initial maturities of one to ten years; and U.S. Treasury bonds, which generally have initial maturities of greater than ten years. The Fund may invest in certain U.S. government securities that are issued or guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the U.S. government including, but not limited to, obligations of U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), and the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”).</P>

In order to purchase Creation Units of the Fund, an investor must generally deposit a designated portfolio of securities (the “Deposit Securities”) (and/or an amount in cash in lieu of some or all of the Deposit Securities) and generally make a cash payment referred to as the “Cash Component”. The list of the names and the amounts of the Deposit Securities will be made available by the Administrator through the facilities of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) immediately prior to the opening of business each day of the NYSE Arca. The Cash Component represents the difference between the net asset value (“NAV”) of a Creation Unit and the market value of the Deposit Securities. Creations and redemptions of Shares may only be made through an “Authorized Participant”, as described in the Registration Statement.</P>
        <P>Shares may be redeemed only in Creation Units at their NAV and only on a day that the NYSE Arca is open for business. The Administrator will make available immediately prior to the opening of business each day, through the facilities of the NSCC, the list of the names and the amounts of the Fund's portfolio securities that will be applicable that day to redemption requests in proper form (“Fund Securities”). Fund Securities received on redemption may not be identical to Deposit Securities, which are applicable to purchases of Creation Units.</P>

        <P>The Exchange proposes to amend Nasdaq Rule 7039 (NASDAQ Last Sale and NASDAQ Last Sale Plus Data Feeds). Nasdaq offers two proprietary data feeds containing real-time last sale information for trades executed on Nasdaq or reported to the Nasdaq/FINRA Trade Reporting Facility. These include the “NASDAQ Last Sale for NASDAQ,” <SU>3</SU>
          <FTREF/> which contains all transaction reports for Nasdaq-listed stocks and “NASDAQ Last Sale for NYSE/NYSE MKT,” <SU>4</SU>

        <P>Specifically, Nasdaq proposes to amend Nasdaq Rule 7039(b) to reduce the monthly fee from $50,000 to $41,500 for each distributor of Nasdaq Last Sale Data Feeds. The new lower fee is designed to incentivize distributors to subscribe to the Nasdaq Last Sale Data Feeds. This fee is exclusive of the $1,500 monthly fee that all distributors of a Nasdaq Last Sale Data Feed must also pay and that is set forth under Nasdaq Rule 7039(c).</P>

In Regulation NMS, while adopting a series of steps to improve the current market model, the Commission highlighted the importance of market forces in determining prices and SRO revenues and, also, recognized that current regulation of the market system “has been remarkably successful in promoting market competition in its broader forms that are most important to investors and listed companies.” <SU>7</SU>

        <P>The Exchange believes that amending Nasdaq Rule 7039(b) to reduce the monthly maximum fee from $50,000 to $41,500 for each distributor of Nasdaq Last Sale Data Feeds (exclusive of the $1,500 monthly fee applicable to all distributors of a Nasdaq Last Sale Data Feed under Nasdaq Rule 7039(c)) is reasonable because Nasdaq believes it will incentivize more distributors to subscribe to the Nasdaq Last Sale Data Feeds.</P>
        <P>The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule fee change is an equitable allocation and is not unfairly discriminatory because the Exchange will apply the new lower fee uniformly across all distributors of Nasdaq Last Sale Data Feeds</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>

        <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. Notwithstanding its determination that the Commission may rely upon competition to establish fair and equitably allocated fees for market data, the <E T="03">NetCoalition</E> court found that the Commission had not, in that case, compiled a record that adequately supported its conclusion that the market for the data at issue in the case was competitive. Nasdaq believes that a record may readily be established to demonstrate the competitive nature of the market in question.</P>
        <P>There is intense competition between trading platforms that provide transaction execution and routing services and proprietary data products. Transaction execution and proprietary data products are complementary in that market data is both an input and a byproduct of the execution service. In fact, market data and trade execution are a paradigmatic example of joint products with joint costs. Data products are valuable to many end Subscribers only insofar as they provide information that end Subscribers expect will assist them or their customers in making trading decisions.</P>
        <P>The costs of producing market data include not only the costs of the data distribution infrastructure, but also the costs of designing, maintaining, and operating the exchange's transaction execution platform and the cost of regulating the exchange to ensure its fair operation and maintain investor confidence. The total return that a trading platform earns reflects the revenues it receives from both products and the joint costs it incurs.</P>
        <P>Moreover, an exchange's customers view the costs of transaction executions and of data as a unified cost of doing business with the exchange. A broker-dealer (“BD”) will direct orders to a particular exchange only if the expected revenues from executing trades on the exchange exceed net transaction execution costs and the cost of data that the BD chooses to buy to support its trading decisions (or those of its customers). The choice of data products is, in turn, a product of the value of the products in making profitable trading decisions. If the cost of the product exceeds its expected value, the BD will choose not to buy it. Moreover, as a BD chooses to direct fewer orders to a particular exchange, the value of the product to that BD decreases, for two reasons. First, the product will contain less information, because executions of the BD's orders will not be reflected in it. Second, and perhaps more important, the product will be less valuable to that BD because it does not provide information about the venue to which it is directing its orders. Data from the competing venue to which the BD is directing orders will become correspondingly more valuable.</P>
        <P>Thus, an increase in the fees charged for either transactions or data has the potential to impair revenues from both products. “No one disputes that competition for order flow is `fierce'.” <SU>12</SU>
          <FTREF/> However, the existence of fierce competition for order flow implies a high degree of price sensitivity on the part of BDs with order flow, since they may readily reduce costs by directing orders toward the lowest-cost trading venues. A BD that shifted its order flow from one platform to another in response to order execution price differentials would both reduce the value of that platform's market data and reduce its own need to consume data from the disfavored platform. Similarly, if a platform increases its market data fees, the change will affect the overall cost of doing business with the platform, and affected BDs will assess whether they can lower their trading costs by directing orders elsewhere and thereby lessening the need for the more expensive data.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>12</SU> <E T="03">Id.</E>
          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Analyzing the cost of market data distribution in isolation from the cost of all of the inputs supporting the creation of market data will inevitably underestimate the cost of the data. Thus, because it is impossible to create data without a fast, technologically robust, and well-regulated execution system, system costs and regulatory costs affect the price of market data. It would be equally misleading, however, to attribute all of the exchange's costs to the market data portion of an exchange's joint product. Rather, all of the exchange's costs are incurred for the unified purposes of attracting order flow, executing and/or routing orders, and generating and selling data about market activity. The total return that an exchange earns reflects the revenues it receives from the joint products and the total costs of the joint products.</P>
        <P>Competition among trading platforms can be expected to constrain the aggregate return each platform earns from the sale of its joint products, but different platforms may choose from a range of possible, and equally reasonable, pricing strategies as the means of recovering total costs. Nasdaq pays rebates to attract orders, charges relatively low prices for market information and charges relatively high prices for accessing posted liquidity. Other platforms may choose a strategy of paying lower liquidity rebates to attract orders, setting relatively low prices for accessing posted liquidity, and setting relatively high prices for market information. Still others may provide most data free of charge and rely exclusively on transaction fees to recover their costs. Finally, some platforms may incentivize use by providing opportunities for equity ownership, which may allow them to charge lower direct fees for executions and data.</P>

        <P>In this environment, there is no economic basis for regulating maximum prices for one of the joint products in an <PRTPAGE P="22346"/>industry in which suppliers face competitive constraints with regard to the joint offering. Such regulation is unnecessary because an “excessive” price for one of the joint products will ultimately have to be reflected in lower prices for other products sold by the firm, or otherwise the firm will experience a loss in the volume of its sales that will be adverse to its overall profitability. In other words, an increase in the price of data will ultimately have to be accompanied by a decrease in the cost of executions, or the volume of both data and executions will fall.</P>
        <P>The level of competition and contestability in the market is evident in the numerous alternative venues that compete for order flow, including eleven SRO markets, as well as internalizing BDs and various forms of alternative trading systems (“ATSs”), including dark pools and electronic communication networks (“ECNs”). Each SRO market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions, and two FINRA-regulated TRFs compete to attract internalized transaction reports. It is common for BDs to further and exploit this competition by sending their order flow and transaction reports to multiple markets, rather than providing them all to a single market. Competitive markets for order flow, executions, and transaction reports provide pricing discipline for the inputs of proprietary data products.</P>
        <P>The large number of SROs, TRFs, BDs, and ATSs that currently produce proprietary data or are currently capable of producing it provides further pricing discipline for proprietary data products. Each SRO, TRF, ATS, and BD is currently permitted to produce proprietary data products, and many currently do or have announced plans to do so, including NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE MKT, NYSE Arca, and BATS/Direct Edge.</P>
        <P>Any ATS or BD can combine with any other ATS, BD, or multiple ATSs or BDs to produce joint proprietary data products. Additionally, order routers and market data vendors can facilitate single or multiple BDs' production of proprietary data products. The potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless. Notably, the potential sources of data include the BDs that submit trade reports to TRFs and that have the ability to consolidate and distribute their data without the involvement of FINRA or an exchange-operated TRF.</P>
        <P>The fact that proprietary data from ATSs, BDs, and vendors can by-pass SROs is significant in two respects. First, non-SROs can compete directly with SROs for the production and sale of proprietary data products, as BATS and NYSE Arca did before registering as exchanges by publishing proprietary book data on the internet. Second, because a single order or transaction report can appear in a core data product, an SRO proprietary product, and/or a non-SRO proprietary product, the data available in proprietary products is exponentially greater than the actual number of orders and transaction reports that exist in the marketplace.</P>
        <P>In addition to the competition and price discipline described above, the market for proprietary data products is also highly contestable because market entry is rapid, inexpensive, and profitable. The history of electronic trading is replete with examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers: Archipelago, Bloomberg Tradebook, Island, RediBook, Attain, TracECN, BATS Trading and BATS/Direct Edge. A proliferation of dark pools and other ATSs operate profitably with fragmentary shares of consolidated market volume.</P>
        <P>Regulation NMS, by deregulating the market for proprietary data, has increased the contestability of that market. While BDs have previously published their proprietary data individually, Regulation NMS encourages market data vendors and BDs to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible. Multiple market data vendors already have the capability to aggregate data and disseminate it on a profitable scale, including Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. In Europe, Cinnober aggregates and disseminates data from over 40 brokers and multilateral trading facilities.<SU>13</SU>

          </P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In the case of TRFs, the rapid entry of several exchanges into this space in 2006-2007 following the development and Commission approval of the TRF structure demonstrates the contestability of this aspect of the market.<SU>14</SU>
          <FTREF/> Given the demand for trade reporting services that is itself a by-product of the fierce competition for transaction executions—characterized notably by a proliferation of ATSs and BDs offering internalization—any supra-competitive increase in the fees associated with trade reporting or TRF data would shift trade report volumes from one of the existing TRFs to the other <SU>15</SU>
          <FTREF/> and create incentives for other TRF operators to enter the space. Alternatively, because BDs reporting to TRFs are themselves free to consolidate the market data that they report, the market for over-the-counter data itself, separate and apart from the markets for execution and trade reporting services—is fully contestable.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>14</SU> The low cost exit of two TRFs from the market is also evidence of a contestable market, because new entrants are reluctant to enter a market where exit may involve substantial shut-down costs.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>15</SU> It should be noted that the FINRA/NYSE TRF has, in recent weeks, received reports for almost 10% of all over-the-counter volume in NMS stocks.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>Moreover, consolidated data provides two additional measures of pricing discipline for proprietary data products that are a subset of the consolidated data stream. First, the consolidated data is widely available in real-time at $1 per month for non-professional users. Second, consolidated data is also available at no cost with a 15- or 20-minute delay. Because consolidated data contains marketwide information, it effectively places a cap on the fees assessed for proprietary data (such as last sale data) that is simply a subset of the consolidated data. The mere availability of low-cost or free consolidated data provides a powerful form of pricing discipline for proprietary data products that contain data elements that are a subset of the consolidated data, by highlighting the optional nature of proprietary products.</P>
        <P>In this instance, the Exchange believes that amending Nasdaq Rule 7039(b) to reduce the monthly maximum fee from $50,000 to $41,500 for each distributor of Nasdaq Last Sale Data Feeds (exclusive of the $1,500 monthly fee that all distributors of a Nasdaq Last Sale Data Feed must also pay and that is set forth under Nasdaq Rule 7039(c)) does not impose a burden on competition and may increase competition through making this a more affordable option for distributors. Accordingly, the Exchange does not believe that the proposed change will impair the ability of members or competing order execution venues to maintain their competitive standing in the financial markets.</P>

        <P>FINRA stated that most trading of agency and GSE Mortgage-Backed Security (“MBS”) takes place in the TBA market, which is characterized by transactions with forward settlements as long as several months past the trade date.<SU>17</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA stated that historically, the TBA market is one of the few markets where a significant portion of activity is unmargined, thereby creating a potential risk arising from counterparty exposure. With a view to this gap between the TBA market versus other markets, FINRA noted the TPMG recommended standards (the “TMPG best practices”) regarding the margining of forward-settling agency MBS transactions.<SU>18</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA stated that the TMPG best practices are recommendations and as such currently are not rule requirements. FINRA's present requirements do not address the TBA market generally.<SU>19</SU>

        <P>• The term “counterparty” means any person that enters into a Covered Agency Transaction with a member and includes a “customer” as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 4210;</P>
        <P>• The term “deficiency” means the amount of any required but uncollected maintenance margin and any required but uncollected mark to market loss;</P>
        <P>• The term “gross open position” means, with respect to Covered Agency Transactions, the amount of the absolute dollar value of all contracts entered into by a counterparty, in all CUSIPs; provided, however, that such amount shall be computed net of any settled position of the counterparty held at the member and deliverable under one or more of the counterparty's contracts with the member and which the counterparty intends to deliver;</P>

        <P>• The term “maintenance margin” means margin equal to two percent of <PRTPAGE P="22349"/>the contract value of the net long or net short position, by CUSIP, with the counterparty;</P>
        <P>• The term “mark to market loss” means the counterparty's loss resulting from marking a Covered Agency Transaction to the market;</P>
        <P>• The term “mortgage banker” means an entity, however organized, that engages in the business of providing real estate financing collateralized by liens on such real estate;</P>
        <P>• The term “round robin” trade means any transaction or transactions resulting in equal and offsetting positions by one customer with two separate dealers for the purpose of eliminating a turnaround delivery obligation by the customer; and</P>
        <P>• The term “standby” means contracts that are put options that trade over-the-counter (“OTC”), as defined in paragraph (f)(2)(A)(xxvii) of Rule 4210, with initial and final confirmation procedures similar to those on forward transactions.</P>

The rule provides that the risk limit determination shall be made by a designated credit risk officer or credit risk committee in accordance with the member's written risk policies and procedures. Further, in connection with risk limit determinations, the proposed rule establishes new Supplementary Material .05. The new Supplementary Material provides that, for purposes of any risk limit determination pursuant to paragraphs (e)(2)(F), (e)(2)(G) or (e)(2)(H) of the rule:</P>
        <P>○  If a member engages in transactions with advisory clients of a registered investment adviser, the member may elect to make the risk limit determination at the investment adviser level, except with respect to any account or group of commonly controlled accounts whose assets managed by that investment adviser constitute more than 10 percent of the investment adviser's regulatory assets under management as reported on the investment adviser's most recent Form ADV;</P>
        <P>○  Members of limited size and resources that do not have a credit risk officer or credit risk committee may designate an appropriately registered principal to make the risk limit determinations;</P>
        <P>○ The member may base the risk limit determination on consideration of all products involved in the member's business with the counterparty, provided the member makes a daily record of the counterparty's risk limit usage; and</P>

However, the rule provides that such transactions must be marked to the market daily and the member must collect any net mark to market loss, unless otherwise provided under paragraph (e)(2)(H)(ii)f. The rule provides that if the mark to market loss is not satisfied by the close of business on the next business day after the business day on which the mark to market loss arises, the member shall be required to deduct the amount of the mark to market loss from net capital as provided in Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1 until such time the mark to market loss is satisfied. The rule requires that if such mark to market loss is not satisfied within five business days from the date the loss was created, the member must promptly liquidate positions to satisfy the mark to market loss, unless FINRA has specifically granted the member additional time.

        </FTNT>
        <P>• The proposed rule change revises the opening sentence of paragraph (e)(2)(F) to clarify that the paragraph's scope does not apply to Covered Agency Transactions as defined pursuant to new paragraph (e)(2)(H). Accordingly, as amended, paragraph (e)(2)(F) states: “Other than for Covered Agency Transactions as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(H) of this Rule . . .” For similar reasons, the proposed rule change revises paragraph (e)(2)(G) to clarify that the paragraph's scope does not apply to a position subject to new paragraph (e)(2)(H) in addition to paragraph (e)(2)(F) as the paragraph currently states. As amended, the parenthetical in the opening sentence of the paragraph states: “([O]ther than a position subject to paragraph (e)(2)(F) or (e)(2)(H) of this Rule).”</P>
        <P>• Current, pre-revision paragraph (e)(2)(H)(i) provides that members must maintain a written risk analysis methodology for assessing the amount of credit extended to exempt accounts pursuant to paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G) of the rule which shall be made available to FINRA upon request. The proposed rule change places this language in paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G) and deletes it from its current location. Accordingly, FINRA proposes to move to paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G): “Members shall maintain a written risk analysis methodology for assessing the amount of credit extended to exempt accounts pursuant to [this paragraph], which shall be made available to FINRA upon request.” Further, FINRA proposes to add to each: “The risk limit determination shall be made by a designated credit risk officer or credit risk committee in accordance with the member's written risk policies and procedures.” FINRA believes Amendment No. 1 makes the risk limit determination language in paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G) more congruent with the corresponding language proposed for new paragraph (e)(2)(H) of the rule.</P>
        <P>• The proposed rule change revises the references in paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G) to the limits on net capital deductions as set forth in current paragraph (e)(2)(H) to read “paragraph (e)(2)(I)” in conformity with that paragraph's redesignation pursuant to the rule change.</P>

        <P>Under current paragraph (e)(2)(H) of FINRA Rule 4210, in brief, a member must provide prompt written notice to FINRA and is prohibited from entering <PRTPAGE P="22351"/>into any new transactions that could increase the member's specified credit exposure if net capital deductions taken by the member as a result of marked to the market losses incurred under paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G), over a five day business period, exceed: (1) For a single account or group of commonly controlled accounts, five percent of the member's tentative net capital (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1); or (2) for all accounts combined, 25 percent of the member's tentative net capital (again, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1). As discussed above, the proposed rule change redesignates current paragraph (e)(2)(H) of the rule as paragraph (e)(2)(I), deletes current paragraph (e)(2)(H)(i), and makes conforming revisions to paragraph (e)(2)(I), as redesignated, for the purpose of clarifying that the provisions of that paragraph are meant to include Covered Agency Transactions as set forth in new paragraph (e)(2)(H). In addition, the proposed rule change clarifies that de minimis transfer amounts must be included toward the five percent and 25 percent thresholds as specified in the rule, as well as amounts pursuant to the specified exception under paragraph (e)(2)(H) for gross open positions of $2.5 million or less in aggregate.</P>
        <P>Redesignated paragraph (e)(2)(I) of the rule provides that, in the event that the net capital deductions taken by a member as a result of deficiencies or marked to the market losses incurred under paragraphs (e)(2)(F) and (e)(2)(G) of the rule (exclusive of the percentage requirements established thereunder), plus any mark to market loss as set forth under paragraph (e)(2)(H)(ii)d. of the rule and any deficiency as set forth under paragraph (e)(2)(H)(ii)e. of the rule, and inclusive of all amounts excepted from margin requirements as set forth under paragraph (e)(2)(H)(ii)c.2. of the rule or any de minimis transfer amount as set forth under paragraph (e)(2)(H)(ii)f. of the rule, exceed: <SU>30</SU>

          <FTREF/> Several commenters asked that FINRA provide guidance to ensure that the risk limit determinations as proposed do not disrupt existing practices or arrangements between mortgage bankers and member firms, are not inconsistently or arbitrarily applied, or are not otherwise interpreted as requiring member firms to impose margin requirements with respect to transactions in the specified products, and called for care in the implementation of the requirement.<SU>36</SU>
          <FTREF/> One commenter asked FINRA to state that there are no conditions at this time that would require margining with respect to such transactions.<SU>37</SU>
          <FTREF/> Some commenters said that FINRA should engage in various forms of communication or outreach to clarify the rule.<SU>38</SU>
          <FTREF/> Other commenters suggested FINRA clarify the intent of the proposed exception by changing “a member may elect not to apply the margin requirements” to “a member is not required to apply the margin requirements.” <SU>39</SU>

        <P>Some commenters opposed the modified rule language in Amendment No. 1 on grounds that the rule should not permit members discretion to impose margin requirements as to multifamily and project loan securities and that such securities should be fully exempted from the proposed rule's application.<SU>41</SU>
          <FTREF/> One commenter said that FINRA should confirm that good faith deposits provide sufficient protection to broker-dealers involved in multifamily and project loan securities transactions, that FINRA did not do analysis of good faith deposits, that giving broker-dealers discretion to impose margin in such transactions protects the broker-dealer but not other parties to the trade, and that in the presence of margin, lenders in multifamily projects will not be able to structure their mortgage costs confidently.<SU>42</SU>
          <FTREF/> Another commenter said that multifamily and project loan securities should be fully exempted from the proposed rule because such securities do not present systemic risk.<SU>43</SU>

          <FTREF/> This commenter said that there are significant protections in place to <PRTPAGE P="22352"/>insulate purchasers of such securities from credit and counterparty risk, that under the proposed rule margin would depend upon a broker-dealer's risk limit determination, that there would be no objective standard for when margin would be required, and that FINRA offered no clear rationale for including multifamily and project loan securities in any margining regime.<SU>44</SU>
          <FTREF/> The commenter proffered language to fully exempt multifamily and project loan securities from the rule's application and suggested that additional language be added to enable broker-dealers and sellers of multifamily and project loan securities to agree contractually on appropriate margin and to count good faith deposits toward margin.<SU>45</SU>

        <P>In response, FINRA is sensitive to commenters' concerns that the proposed rule not disrupt business activity. FINRA stated in Amendment No. 1 that FINRA is not proposing at this time to require that members apply the proposed margin requirements <SU>46</SU>
          <FTREF/> to multifamily and project loan securities, subject to the conditions as specified in proposed paragraph (e)(2)(H)(ii)a.2. of Rule 4210. In the interest of further clarity, FINRA proposes in Amendment No. 2 to revise the phrase “a member may elect not to apply the margin requirements . . .” in paragraph (e)(2)(H)(ii)a.2. to read “a member is not required to apply the margin requirements . . .” <SU>47</SU>
          <FTREF/> However, while the rule is not intended to require margin as to transactions in multifamily and project loan securities, neither is it intended to prevent members from imposing margin. As FINRA stated in Amendment No. 1, the proposal imposes on members the requirement to make and enforce risk limits as to counterparties in multifamily and project loan securities to help ensure that members are properly monitoring their risk. The rule presumes that risk limits will be a tool that members may employ to exercise sound discretion as to the management of their business. Members need, and under FINRA rules have, discretion to impose margin over and above the requirements under the rules.<SU>48</SU>
          <FTREF/> Though it is possible that members' application of the risk limit requirements may lead to different determinations among members as to multifamily and project loan securities, FINRA notes that members and their counterparties have been transacting in these products for a considerable time and they are well understood to the industry. FINRA will consider further guidance as needed.</P>

In response, in Amendment No. 2, FINRA proposes to revise proposed paragraph (e)(2)(H)(ii)a.2.A. to add the phrase “or are such other multifamily housing securities or project loan program securities with substantially similar characteristics, issued in conformity with a program of an Agency or a Government-Sponsored Enterprise, as FINRA may designate by Regulatory Notice or similar communication.” As such, proposed paragraph (e)(2)(H)(ii)a.2.A. as revised would read: “. . . such securities are issued in conformity with a program of an Agency, as defined in Rule 6710(k), or a Government-Sponsored Enterprise, as defined in Rule 6710(n), and are documented as Freddie Mac K Certificates, Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing bonds, or Ginnie Mae Construction Loan or Project Loan Certificates, as commonly known to the trade, or are such other multifamily housing securities or project loan program securities with substantially similar characteristics, issued in conformity with a program of an Agency or a Government-Sponsored Enterprise, as FINRA may designate by Regulatory Notice or similar communication . . .” <SU>49</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA believes that the revised language should help promote clarity in the rule's application by ensuring that FINRA has the ability to efficiently include within the scope of the proposed exception, by Regulatory Notice or similar communication, any multifamily and project loan securities, consistent with the rule's intent, that may otherwise inadvertently be omitted.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>In response to comments, FINRA believes that a complete exemption for multifamily and project loan securities, not only with respect to the margin requirements, but also the obligation of members to make and enforce risk limits, would not serve the interests of sound regulation.<SU>50</SU>
          <FTREF/> As already noted above and in Amendment No. 1, the rule's risk limit provisions are designed as an appropriately tailored requirement to ensure that members are properly managing their risk. It would undercut the core purposes of the rule to create classes of products within the Covered Agency Transactions category where such monitoring is not required. FINRA does not believe that a separate analysis of good faith deposits is necessary given that, as more fully set forth in Amendment No. 1, FINRA took note of the provision of good faith deposits by the borrower to the lender, among other characteristics of multifamily and project loan securities, in considering the exception set forth in the proposed rule. Nor does FINRA propose to introduce into the rule language providing for negotiation of margin or for recognition of good faith deposits. FINRA does not object to parties engaging in negotiation, provided the margin requirements as set forth under the rule are met. FINRA does not believe it is necessary to separately set forth a rationale for regulation of multifamily and project loan securities for purposes of Amendment No. 2 given that, in the original filing, FINRA set forth in full the rationale for regulating Covered Agency Transactions and, in Amendment No. 1, FINRA specifically addressed its proposed approach to multifamily and project loan securities.<SU>51</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Impact and Costs of the Proposal (Other Than With Respect to Multifamily and Project Loan Securities)</HD>
        <P>Commenters expressed concerns regarding the proposed rule's potential impact on the market and the costs of implementing the requirements.<SU>56</SU>
          <FTREF/> One commenter believed that the comment period has been inadequate and that FINRA did not quantify the proposal's burdens on all broker-dealers and market participants.<SU>57</SU>
          <FTREF/> This commenter said that FINRA's economic impact statement in the proposed rule change was deficient.<SU>58</SU>
          <FTREF/> Another commenter said FINRA should consider the comprehensive costs and burdens of the proposal vis-à-vis the cost of alternatives recommended by the commenter.<SU>59</SU>
          <FTREF/> This commenter also said its members have observed the shifting of TBA market business to non-FINRA members, who have a significant competitive advantage over FINRA-regulated broker-dealers.<SU>60</SU>
          <FTREF/> Further, this commenter said that the proposal would result in a reduction in the number of investors willing to invest in TBA market products, and that it would be willing to work with FINRA to supply market or economic information within the access of its members.<SU>61</SU>
          <FTREF/> One commenter said that the costs of the proposal would be considerable, that implementation work would be extensive in executing or renegotiating Master Securities Forward Transaction Agreements (“MSFTAs”), and that requirements such as maintenance margin and position liquidation would impose additional costs.<SU>62</SU>
          <FTREF/> Another commenter said the proposal would have an inequitable impact on competition between small dealers and large dealers, that many small dealers would exit the TBA market rather than implement the rule, that large firms might not be willing to deal with small firms, and that liquidity for small firms would be negatively affected.<SU>63</SU>
          <FTREF/> A different commenter said that many firms that pose no systemic risk potential and do only a moderate amount of mortgage business may choose to exit the marketplace rather than comply with the rule, which would further harm liquidity in the U.S. fixed income market, with possible adverse effects on the U.S. mortgage market, and that the proposal would require small-to-medium sized dealers to execute margin agreements with all their mortgage counterparties.<SU>64</SU>
          <FTREF/> This commenter said that large investment managers would be unlikely to agree to execute margin agreements with an unlimited number of counterparties.<SU>65</SU>
          <FTREF/> Similarly, another commenter said that the proposal would exacerbate a concentration of activity in the largest active firms and that the rule would impose burdens on investment managers, who would enter into margin agreements only with the largest dealer counterparties, thereby negatively impacting smaller firms.<SU>66</SU>
          <FTREF/> One commenter stated that as a result of the proposal only FINRA members would be required to impose margin requirements and that non-FINRA member banks that currently are following the TMPG best practices may choose not to do so.<SU>67</SU>
          <FTREF/> This commenter said that smaller members would exit the market rather than implement the required margin.<SU>68</SU>
          <FTREF/> Similarly, another commenter said large firms that follow the TMPG best practices already have margining mechanisms in place but that smaller firms would be disproportionately affected by the proposal because more TBA market transactions will migrate to non-FINRA member banks.<SU>69</SU>
          <FTREF/> This commenter said the proposal would lead to fewer competitors and higher costs for consumers.<SU>70</SU>

        <P>Some commenters proffered estimates as to the cost of implementing the proposal.<SU>71</SU>
          <FTREF/> A commenter said the proposal would require FINRA members of all sizes, regardless of how active they are in the market, to hire new personnel to comply with the rule.<SU>72</SU>
          <FTREF/> This commenter said that hiring three new employees to staff a new margin department would cost an estimated $150,000 per employee per year, that third party vendor technology could cost $625,000 in licensing fees in the first year, and that a competing vendor solution would cost as much as $875,000 over the first two years of use.<SU>73</SU>
          <FTREF/> Another commenter stated that buying or licensing a system to comply with the rule would cost over $100,000, that there would be costs for development resources, and that cost for implementation could run to $250,000 or more.<SU>74</SU>
          <FTREF/> This commenter said that third party pricing would be between $150,000 and $400,000 per year depending on the vendor, that two or maybe three employees would be needed, and that this could cost an additional $200,000 per year.<SU>75</SU>
          <FTREF/> This commenter said the ongoing cost of the proposal would be in the $300,000 to $400,000 range.<SU>76</SU>

        <P>In response, FINRA addressed the commenters' concerns in the original filing and in Amendment No. 1.<SU>77</SU>
          <FTREF/> In the original filing, FINRA set forth an extensive analysis of the proposal's potential impact.<SU>78</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA addressed, among other things, the proposal's potential impact on mortgage bankers,<SU>79</SU>
          <FTREF/> broker-dealers, including smaller firms,<SU>80</SU>
          <FTREF/> and retail customers and consumers, and presented quantitative analysis of trade and account data.<SU>81</SU>
          <FTREF/> As FINRA discussed in the original filing, and again in response to comments in Amendment No. 1, FINRA noted that there will likely be direct and indirect costs associated with the rule change, and that firms will be impacted.<SU>82</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA considered and analyzed alternatives.<SU>83</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA also set forth the need for the rule change, including the need to manage the risk to members extending credit and to help maintain a properly functioning retail mortgage market even in stressed market conditions.<SU>84</SU>

          <FTREF/> FINRA noted that comment on the proposed rule change has been solicited on three occasions: First in response to <E T="03">Regulatory Notice</E> 14-02; <SU>85</SU>

          <FTREF/> second in response to the original filing; and third in response to the Order Instituting Proceedings. In three rounds of comment, with a total of <PRTPAGE P="22354"/>132 individual letter comments,<SU>86</SU>
          <FTREF/> a handful of commenters have provided in the public record specific, quantified estimates as to the potential cost of implementing the proposed rule change.<SU>87</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA notes commenters concerns as to the quantitative analysis.<SU>88</SU>
          <FTREF/> However, FINRA further notes that a key purpose of the comment process is to supply the public record with specific information for regulators to consider in the development of rulemaking. FINRA notes that it is of little assistance to the comment process to state in a comment letter that the pertinent information is available, and then not provide such information in the letter for public review.</P>

        <P>In response to comments, FINRA has engaged in ongoing discussions with various market participants and providers to understand the potential regulatory costs of compliance with the proposed rule.<SU>89</SU>
          <FTREF/> Similar to the original filing,<SU>90</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA believes the commenters' estimates fall toward the higher end of the cost range for building, upgrading, maintaining, licensing or outsourcing the necessary systems and hiring of necessary staff. FINRA understands that estimates will vary depending on the size and business model of a firm, and the extent of its current and anticipated involvement in TBA market transactions.</P>

        </FTNT>
        <P>As a result of these ongoing discussions, FINRA understands that some firms have been transacting in the TBA market for years and margining has been a common practice due to the TMPG best practices or prudent counterparty risk management practices at these firms. These firms already have the technology and staffing in place for collateral management in their repo, swap and OTC derivatives transactions and would only have to build into their current systems the exceptions provided for under the proposed rule.<SU>91</SU>
          <FTREF/> Costs associated with such enhancements or additions to the current systems should vary based on the scalability and flexibility of such systems. For instance, sources at one firm estimated that it required approximately 60 hours of programming time, at a cost of approximately $5,000, to build systems to track margin obligations consistent with the TMPG best practices. The same firm did not plan to hire additional staff to track margin obligations pursuant to the proposed rule; however, another firm estimated that its total annual costs to comply with the proposed requirements could run from $60,000 to $100,000, including both staffing and technology costs.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>91</SU> <E T="03">See, e.g.,</E> the “cash account” exceptions and the de minimis transfer amount as discussed in Sections F and G, respectively, of Amendment No. 2.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>FINRA understands that there are various technology solutions and service providers for firms that have relatively less engagement in TBA market transactions, and therefore would need more affordable and flexible products. One service provider to firms noted that costs could vary widely depending on the level of service that a firm purchases and estimated that it would be typical of its firm customers to pay, in addition to a basic set up fee of $1,000, approximately $1,000 to $2,500 per month for the use of a web-based system to manage margin requirements pursuant to the proposed rule. While this service is purely designed to compute margin obligations, the provider estimated that a firm seeking more robust levels of service, which would include a more sophisticated tracking system of counterparty exposures and margin obligations for all of its asset types, including margining for TBA market transactions, could spend higher amounts on software to manage such systems, and that installation and preparation would require approximately one week.</P>
        <P>FINRA understands that firms with significant trading activity in the TBA market may already have the systems built, or the flexibility to enhance current systems, to comply with the proposed rule, whereas firms with relatively little activity in this market, whose business models and trading activity would qualify them for the exceptions as set forth in the proposed rule, can find affordable solutions. One firm that does a significant business in the TBA market said that it has already built systems to reflect the TMPG best practices and estimated it would need to spend $50,000 to $100,000 on additional software and technology costs to reflect the additional requirements under the proposed rule change, and would need to hire two to three additional staff at approximately $70,000 to $100,000 per person to track margin obligations. FINRA acknowledges that there may also be firms whose customers' trading activity in the TBA market may qualify them for the de minimis transfer exception on some days only, and may be at a level that would require a more sophisticated margin tracking system on other days. Implementation costs may be higher for such firms, as they may have to determine the size of their activity in TBA market transactions and hence scale their systems accordingly, or they may choose to implement more rigorous solutions in order to avoid non-compliance. FINRA recognizes that some firms may seek to update existing master agreements or to renegotiate master agreement terms upon the adoption of the proposed rule. Any related costs to these activities will likely vary with the amount of the activity conducted by a member, the number of counterparties and the amount of the activity conducted by its counterparties.</P>

          <FTREF/> FINRA notes that Specified Pool Transactions, ARMs, CMOs and the SBA securities as specified under the rule all share the type of extended settlement risk that the proposed rule change aims to address, for which reason they are included within the scope of Covered Agency Transactions. FINRA's reasoning and <PRTPAGE P="22355"/>approach as to multifamily and project loan securities, as set forth in Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, are designed with a view to those products in the totality of their characteristics, which is distinct from the products raised by the commenters.

        <P>One commenter said that the proposed rule change effectively mandates that members create an account type that would be specific to TBA market transactions.<SU>98</SU>
          <FTREF/> This commenter said that is because the proposed rule imposes distinct requirements from other types of products, and that the requirements are being imposed at the same time as industry is preparing to expend significant resources to migrate to “T+2” settlement.</P>

        <P>In response, FINRA notes that the proposed rule does not mandate the creation of account types dedicated to TBA market transactions. Based on discussions with various market participants and service providers, FINRA believes it is well within the operational and technological ability of firms to appropriately handle margining of TBA market transactions. As discussed above, FINRA has acknowledged that implementation of the proposal will involve costs. FINRA is aware that the proposed rule change is not the only regulatory development that could affect firms. At the same time, however, FINRA notes that regulation, like industry, continually evolves with new and ongoing initiatives. FINRA is aware that the T+2 migration will involve demands on member resources, yet FINRA also notes that the T+2 initiative, with all its attendant resource demands, has been sought and advocated by industry.<SU>99</SU>
          <FTREF/> It would not be consistent with FINRA's mission of investor protection and market integrity, nor could it ever be feasible, for FINRA to refrain from rulemaking until the completion of every initiative by other regulators and by industry that could impose burdens or demands on resources.</P>

          <FTREF/> FINRA noted that maintenance margin is a mainstay of margin regimes in the securities industry, and, as such, the need to appropriately track transactions should be well understood to market participants. FINRA is sensitive to commenters' concerns as to the potential impact of the requirement on members and their non-exempt customer accounts. For this reason, as set forth more fully in the original filing, and as discussed further below, FINRA revised the proposal to include an exception tailored to customers engaging in non-margined, cash account business.<SU>107</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. “Cash Account” Exceptions</HD>
        <P>As set forth more fully in the original filing, the proposed margin requirements would not apply to any counterparty that has gross open positions <SU>109</SU>
          <FTREF/> in Covered Agency Transactions with the member amounting to $2.5 million or less in aggregate, if the original contractual settlement for all such transactions is in the month of the trade date for such transactions or in the month succeeding the trade date for such transactions and the counterparty regularly settles its Covered Agency Transactions on a DVP basis or for cash. Similarly, a non-exempt account would be excepted from the rule's proposed two percent maintenance margin requirement if the original contractual settlement for the Covered Agency Transaction is in the month of the trade date for such transaction or in the month succeeding the trade date for such transaction and the customer regularly settles its Covered Agency Transactions on a DVP basis or for cash. The rule uses parallel language with respect to both of these exceptions to provide that they are not available to a counterparty that, in its transactions with the member, engages in dollar rolls, as defined in FINRA Rule 6710(z),<SU>110</SU>
          <FTREF/> or “round robin” <SU>111</SU>

        <P>In response, FINRA addressed commenters' concerns in Amendment No. 1 and does not propose to modify the cash account exceptions as proposed in the original filing.<SU>117</SU>
          <FTREF/> The cash account exceptions are designed to help address the concerns of smaller participants in the market. If members believe that it is too onerous to offer these exceptions to their customers, they are not obligated under the rule to do so. Commenters on the original filing asked for guidance as to the term “regularly settles,” <SU>118</SU>
          <FTREF/> and in response FINRA noted that, as worded, the term “regularly settles” is designed to provide scope for flexibility on members' part as to how they implement the exceptions. FINRA said that it expects that members are in a position to make reasonable judgments as to the observed pattern and course of dealing in their customers' behavior by virtue of their interactions with their customers. However, FINRA does not agree with one commenter's interpretation that “regularly” is to be equated with “substantial portion of the time.” <SU>119</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA views the term “regularly” as conveying the prevailing or dominant pattern and course of the customer's behavior. FINRA stated in Amendment No. 1 that, in ascertaining the customer's regular pattern, a member may use the customer's history of transactions with the member, as well as any other relevant information of which the member is aware, and, further, that members should be able to rely on the reasonable representations of their customers where necessary for purposes of the requirement. As FINRA noted in Amendment No. 1, FINRA will consider issuing further guidance as needed.<SU>120</SU>

Further, unless FINRA has specifically granted the member additional time, the member is required to liquidate positions if, with respect to exempt accounts, a mark to market loss is not satisfied within five business days, or, with respect to non-exempt accounts, a deficiency is not satisfied within such period.<SU>131</SU>

        <P>In response, FINRA addressed the commenters' concerns in Amendment No. 1.<SU>138</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA does not propose to modify the proposed requirements. As FINRA noted in Amendment No. 1, consistent with longstanding practice under FINRA Rule 4210(f)(6), the proposed rule allows FINRA to specifically grant the member additional time.<SU>139</SU>
          <FTREF/> FINRA maintains, and regularly updates,<SU>140</SU>
          <FTREF/> the Regulatory Extension System for this purpose, which is well understood to industry participants. In response to comments, FINRA notes that the Regulatory Extension System does not grant waivers from requirements under Rule 4210, whether permanent or temporary.<SU>141</SU>
          <FTREF/> Additional time is granted, pursuant to the rule, for meeting specified obligations and, consistent with longstanding practice under the rule, FINRA may limit or restrict the extensions granted for a firm or customer. FINRA will consider additional guidance as needed. FINRA referenced the portfolio margin rules in Amendment No. 1 to illustrate that, with respect to the timing of margin collection, the proposed language “by the close of business on the next business day after the business day” on which the mark to market loss or deficiency arises is consistent with existing language under Rule 4210 and is well understood by members.<SU>142</SU>
          <FTREF/> With respect to the liquidation requirement, FINRA noted that the five business day period should provide sufficient time for members to resolve issues. Further, as FINRA noted in the original filing and in Amendment No. 1, FINRA believes the specified period is appropriate in view of the potential counterparty risk in the TBA market.<SU>143</SU>

          <FTREF/> The commenters cited the Senate Report <SU>163</SU>

In response, FINRA notes that Section 7 of the Exchange Act sets forth the parameters of the margin setting authority of the Federal Reserve Board and does not bar action by FINRA. SMMEA does not address FINRA's authority as the statute was designed, among other things, to level the competitive playing field between issuers of private-label MBS (defined under the SMMEA as “mortgage related securities” under Section 3(a)(41) of the Exchange Act) vis-à-vis agency and GSE MBS.<SU>165</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD2">P. Implementation Period</HD>
        <P>In Amendment No. 1, FINRA stated that it believes that a phased implementation should be appropriate. FINRA proposed that the risk limit determination requirements as set forth in paragraphs (e)(2)(F), (e)(2)(G) and (e)(2)(H) of Rule 4210 and proposed Supplementary Material .05 of the rule become effective six months from the date the proposed rule change is approved by the Commission. FINRA proposed that the remainder of the proposed rule change become effective 18 months from the date the proposed rule change is approved by the Commission.<SU>167</SU>
          <FTREF/> One commenter said 18 months represents a reasonable time frame.<SU>168</SU>
          <FTREF/> Another commenter said that the implementation time frame as proposed in Amendment No. 1 is sufficiently reasonable.<SU>169</SU>
          <FTREF/> A different commenter said that compliance with the proposed requirements would be difficult to complete and that it would prefer a time frame of 24 months, but that its members could aim to complete their implementation work within 18 months.<SU>170</SU>
          <FTREF/> One commenter said that an implementation period of at least 18 months would be appropriate and that two years would be more practical.<SU>171</SU>
          <FTREF/> This commenter said that the proposed six-month period for implementation of the risk limit requirements would effectively require broker-dealers to complete their diligence as to their customers within six months even though the proposed rule does not take effect in full until a year after that six-month period.<SU>172</SU>
          <FTREF/> Another commenter said that it would need 18 to 24 months to complete implementation of the proposed requirements and suggested that FINRA should not have a separate time frame for the risk limit requirements.<SU>173</SU>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Project Description</HD>

        <P>On April 22, 2015, Upland Pipeline, LLC (Upland), which is a subsidiary of TransCanada Pipeline Limited, submitted an application for a new Presidential Permit under E. O. 13337 of April 30, 2004 (69 FR 25299) to <PRTPAGE P="22360"/>authorize the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of pipeline facilities for the export of crude oil, which would be located at the border of the United States and Canada. Upland amended the application on July 8, 2015 to make it compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and added other required clarifications. The Upland project is designed to transport crude oil from the Williston Basin region in North Dakota into Canada.</P>
        <P>The proposed pipeline would have the capacity to transport approximately 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil. The requested Presidential Permit, if granted, would cover the border segment of pipeline between the northernmost mainline shutoff valve in the United States (Upland plans indicate this will be near milepost 108 of the proposed project route in Burke County, North Dakota) and the United States-Canada border.</P>
        <P>The proposed Upland project would consist of approximately 124 miles of new 20-inch diameter pipeline located in Williams, Mountrail, and Burke counties, North Dakota. The proposed pipeline would have 15 mainline valves (MLV), one at each of the five oil receipt facilities and ten located along the pipeline route. The proposed project would include five new aboveground receipt facilities, three of which would also include a pump station at each. Four of the new receipt facilities (near Aune, Epping, Beaver Lodge, and Tioga) would be located on approximately 25-acre sites and each would have one storage tank with a design capacity of 100,000 barrels (bbl). One of the new receipt facilities (Trenton) would be located on an approximately 52-acre site and include one 300,000 bbl oil storage tank. Each of the five receipt facilities would include associated pumps, valves, truck unloading facilities, and support equipment and facilities. Temporary construction facilities would include three pipe yards, four rail sidings, and one contractor yard. Fuel storage would be established at the contractor yard and pipe yards. Access roads would be constructed to provide adequate access to the construction sites and to the receipt facilities and MLVs. The proposed project would also include the establishment of one temporary workforce camp, in Williams County, North Dakota, if needed to meet the housing needs of the construction workforce during construction. In addition to the project facilities, electric power lines and associated facility upgrades would be constructed, as required, by local electric power providers to supply power to the receipt facilities and the MLVs. The facility upgrades would include the construction and installation of new substations and transformers to meet the power demands of the receipt facilities.</P>
        <P>The Canadian portion of the Upland Pipeline system would include a 20-inch diameter pipeline that would extend from the United States-Canada border near Northgate, Saskatchewan to Moosomin, Saskatchewan or Cromer, Manitoba. Review and approval of the proposed Canadian facilities will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Canadian National Energy Board as well as various local, municipal, and provincial authorities.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">The EIS Process</HD>
        <P>After due consideration of the nature and extent of the proposed project, including evaluation of the “Environmental Review” section of the Presidential Permit application, and comments received from the public in a previous FR notice published July 31, 2015 (80 FR 45697), the Department, consistent with NEPA, determined that the appropriate level of NEPA review for this project is an EIS. The Department will use the EIS to assess the environmental impacts that could result if Upland is granted a Presidential Permit. The Department will prepare the EIS with the assistance of a third-party contractor and invite cooperating agencies to participate in the development of the EIS.</P>
        <P>The EIS will evaluate potential environmental, social, cultural, and economic impacts in the United States from the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of the proposed pipeline facilities. This Notice is intended to inform agencies and the public of the proposed project, and to solicit comments and suggestions for the Department's consideration in its preparation of the EIS.</P>
        <P>The Department intends to analyze impacts across a number of resource areas, including:</P>
        <P>• Air quality (including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions);</P>
        <P>• Water resources, including wetlands, floodplains, waterways, water supplies and drainage;</P>
        <P>• Geography, geology, and soils;</P>
        <P>• Land use;</P>
        <P>• Threatened and endangered species, special status species, and related sensitive resources;</P>
        <P>• Public health and safety;</P>
        <P>• Noise;</P>
        <P>• Hazardous materials;</P>
        <P>• Accidental spills and intentional destructive acts;</P>
        <P>• Cultural and historical resources;</P>
        <P>• Socioeconomic impacts, community services and infrastructure;</P>
        <P>• Environmental justice considerations (disproportionately high and adverse impacts to minority and low income populations); and</P>
        <P>• Cumulative impacts (past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions).</P>
        <P>This list is not intended to be all inclusive or to imply any predetermination of impacts. The Department invites interested parties to suggest specific issues within these general categories, or other issues not included above, to be considered in the EIS. While the President has delegated authority to the Department to issue permits for pipeline facilities at the borders of the United States, the environmental review will analyze impacts along the length of the proposed project in the United States that are dependent upon Permit issuance.</P>

        <P>The scoping meeting will be held on May 10, 2016 as detailed in the <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E> section. The meeting will provide interested parties the opportunity to view proposed project exhibits and make comments. Department employees will be available to answer questions and provide additional information to attendees to the extent that additional information is available at this early stage of the environmental review. Persons who do not wish to submit comments or suggestions at this time but who would like to receive status updates on the EIS process, including a notification when the Draft EIS is available for review and comment, should notify the Upland Project Manager, as provided in <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E> or go to <E T="03">http://www.state.gov/e/enr/applicant/applicants/uplandpipeline/</E> to register to be on the mailing list.</P>
        <P>All comments received during the scoping period may be made public, no matter how initially submitted. Comments are not private and will not be edited to remove identifying or contact information. Commenters are cautioned against including any information that they would not want publicly disclosed. Any party soliciting or aggregating comments from other persons is further requested to direct those persons not to include any identifying or contact information, or information they would not want publicly disclosed, in their comments.</P>

        <SUBJECT>KCVN, LLC and Colorado Pacific Railroad, LLC—Feeder Line Application—Line of V and S Railway, LLC, Located in Crowley, Pueblo, Otero, and Kiowa Counties, Colorado</SUBJECT>
        <P>On March 18, 2016, KCVN, LLC (KCVN) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Colorado Pacific Railroad, LLC (Colorado Pacific) (collectively applicants) jointly filed an application under the feeder line provision at 49 U.S.C. 10907 to acquire a 121.9-mile line of railroad owned by V and S Railway, LLC (V&amp;S) in southeast Colorado. The line, known as the Towner Line, extends between milepost 747.5 near Towner and milepost 869.4 near NA Junction in Pueblo, Crowley, Kiowa, and Otero Counties, Colo. As discussed below, the application is substantially complete and will be accepted. However, the applicants should provide certain supplemental material described below by April 29, 2016. This decision also establishes a procedural schedule.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>The Towner Line has been the subject of two other Board proceedings during the past two years. In Docket No. NOR 42140, KCVN, the Colorado Wheat Administrative Committee, the Colorado Association of Wheat Growers, and the Colorado Wheat Research Foundation (collectively, the Colorado Interests) filed a complaint on October 28, 2014, alleging that V&amp;S violated 49 U.S.C. 11101 and 10903 by removing certain track and related assets from a segment of the Towner Line (the Western Segment) without first seeking abandonment authority.<SU>1</SU>
          <FTREF/> On May 7, 2015, the Board partially granted the Colorado Interests' concurrently filed motion for preliminary injunction, and barred V&amp;S from removing and dismantling track and related assets from the Western Segment pending the Board's ruling on the complaint. Thereafter the parties moved to hold the complaint case in abeyance pending V&amp;S's decision to seek abandonment authority for the Towner Line. The Board granted this request in a decision served on July 17, 2015, and the complaint case remains in abeyance.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>
            <SU>1</SU> The Western Segment extends between milepost 808.3 near Haswell, Colo., and milepost 868.5, which is approximately 0.9 miles short of the Towner Line's western terminus at milepost 869.4.</P>
        </FTNT>

        <P>On August 3, 2015, V&amp;S filed a verified notice of exemption in Docket No. AB 603 (Sub-No. 4X) to abandon the Towner Line, as it had agreed to do in Docket No. NOR 42140. The Board served and published notice of the exemption in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>, and KCVN and Colorado Pacific sought information from V&amp;S to allow them to file an offer of financial assistance under 49 U.S.C. 10904 to purchase the line. V&amp;S provided the information, but that information suggested that the Towner Line passes through a county and zip code not included in V&amp;S's verified notice. The Board therefore directed V&amp;S to supplement its verified notice if necessary. Rather than filing a supplement, V&amp;S attempted to amend the notice to seek authority to only discontinue operations over the Towner Line rather than abandon it. KCVN opposed that amendment. In a decision served on January 15, 2016, the Board <PRTPAGE P="22362"/>rejected V&amp;S's November 30 amendment. The Board found that, if V&amp;S wished to pursue discontinuance authority for the Towner Line, it must either file a petition for exemption under 49 U.S.C 10502 or a formal application under 49 U.S.C. 10903. The Board further stated that V&amp;S could supplement its original notice of exemption if it instead decided to continue seeking abandonment authority. On January 27, 2016, V&amp;S gave notice of its desire to withdraw its notice of exemption seeking abandonment authority.<SU>2</SU>

        </FTNT>
        <P>On March 18, 2016, KCVN and Colorado Pacific initiated this proceeding by filing a feeder line application under 49 U.S.C. 10907 to acquire the Towner Line and 12 miles of related track and facilities. Under section 10907(b)(1), the Board is authorized to require the sale of a rail line to a financially responsible person if the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale.<SU>3</SU>

          <FTREF/> The applicants claim that the proposed sale is required under the public convenience and necessity criterion and that Colorado Pacific is a financially responsible person willing to pay not less than the constitutional minimum value of the line. The applicants allege that V&amp;S engaged in a systemic plan to drive traffic off the Towner Line with the ultimate aim of abandoning it and selling the line's rail assets. The applicants assert that V&amp;S raised rates to a prohibitive level around 2011 and engaged in other behavior forcing traffic off the line rather than meeting its common carrier obligation and maintaining the line. The applicants argue that the Board has found previously that this type of behavior can lead to a forced sale under the feeder line statute. <E T="03">See Keokuk Junction Ry.—Feeder Line Acquis.—Line of Toledo Peoria &amp; W. Ry. Between La Harpe &amp; Hollis, Ill.,</E> 7 S.T.B. 893 (2004).</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>3</SU> The Board also is to require a sale to a financially responsible person if the line is currently in category 1 or 2 of the owning railroad's system diagram map and the owning railroad has not filed an application to abandon the line. <E T="03">See</E> 49 U.S.C. 10907(b)(1)(A)(ii); 49 CFR 1151.1. The applicants argue that the Towner Line also satisfies this criterion.</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>According to the applicants, Colorado Pacific seeks to acquire the Towner Line and its related track and facilities and lease them to a connecting carrier, Kansas &amp; Oklahoma Railroad (K&amp;O), to operate. Although the parties are still in negotiations, the applicants provide a supporting verified statement from a representative of K&amp;O's owner. The applicants also include verified statements supporting the application from a local farmer and representatives of Bartlett Grain Co., LP, Tallman Grain Co., Inc., and Thunderbird L&amp;L, Inc.</P>
        <P>The applicants state that Colorado Pacific offers to buy the Towner Line for its net liquidation value (NLV), which the applicants estimate to be $2,594,551, rather than the line's going concern value (GCV), which they estimate to be $0 given that V&amp;S provides no service. The applicants assert that rehabilitating the Towner Line would cost an additional $3,500,000, bringing the total cost to restore service to $6 million. The applicants claim that Colorado Pacific can afford these costs and that it is financially responsible. Specifically, they note that KCVN would fund Colorado Pacific's acquisition and other expenses with cash. As support, they provide a KCVN account statement showing assets of approximately $6.5 million. The applicants also note that KCVN owns 58,000 acres of farmland primarily dedicated to dryland wheat within 25 miles of the Towner Line, which collectively are valued at approximately $50 million (Application 8), and that KCVN has wealthy principals and would make funds available to meet additional acquisition, rehabilitation, maintenance, and operations costs if necessary (Application, Exhibit A at 5).</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Discussion and Conclusions</HD>
        <P>Under 49 CFR 1151.2(b), the Board, through the Director of the Office of Proceedings, must accept a complete feeder line application, or reject one that is incomplete, no later than 30 days after the application is filed. An application is complete if it has been properly served <SU>4</SU>

          <FTREF/> and contains substantially all the information required by § 1151.3, except as modified by advance waiver. 49 CFR 1151.2(b)(1). Notice of an acceptance must be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and provide a procedural schedule for the proceeding. <E T="03">Id.</E>

        <P>The Board has determined that the applicants have provide substantially all the information required by § 1151.3 and therefore accepts the feeder line application.

          <E T="03">Financial Responsibility</E> (1151.3(a)(3)). An application must include information sufficient to demonstrate that it is a financially responsible person, able to pay the higher of the NLV or GCV of the line and to cover expenses associated with providing service over the line for at least the first three years after the line is acquired. Based on the information in the application, Colorado Pacific appears to have access to considerable funds to pay the expenses of acquiring and rehabilitating the Towner Line.<SU>6</SU>
          <FTREF/> Colorado Pacific states that it does not anticipate incurring operating costs because they would be borne by K&amp;O, the anticipated operator. Nonetheless, the applicants should provide financial statements showing a breakdown of three years of K&amp;O service costs, including maintenance costs, to fully demonstrate that Colorado Pacific or KCVN could cover any revenue shortfall during the first three years.</P>

          <E T="03">Operating Plan</E> (1151.3(a)(7)). Although the applicants and K&amp;O have provided basic information about the common carrier freight operations K&amp;O would perform, they indicate that the specifics of an operating plan are still being developed. The applicants should provide the Board with more detail, including an estimate of the average number of trains anticipated to be operated over the line per day.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">Liability Insurance</E> (1151.3(a)(8)). Colorado Pacific and K&amp;O anticipate that the lease and operating agreement they are negotiating would provide that K&amp;O secure and maintain at all times an insurance policy from a reputable insurance company that provides for commercial liability coverage in an amount not less than $25 million. In addition to the information provided in the application, the applicants should also submit to the Board a certificate of K&amp;O's existing insurance coverage over its current system.</P>

          <P>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces May 2, 2016, as the deadline for each airport sponsor to notify the FAA whether or not it will use its fiscal year 2016 entitlement funds available under Section 47114 of Title 49, United States Code, to accomplish Airport Improvement Program (AIP) eligible projects that the airport sponsor previously identified through the Airports Capital Improvement Plan (ACIP) process during the preceding year.</P>
          <P>The airport sponsor's notification must address all entitlement funds available to date for fiscal year 2016, as well as any entitlement funds not obligated from prior years. After Friday, July 1, 2016, the FAA will carry-over the remainder of currently available entitlement funds, and these funds will not be available again until at least the beginning of fiscal year 2017. Currently, the AIP has 79 percent of the entitlements available through July 15, 2016. If congressional action is taken on future extensions which provide for additional current year and protected entitlements (the remaining 21 percent), the FAA will then work with airport sponsors to adjust accordingly. This notification requirement does not apply to non-primary airports covered by the block-grant program.</P>

        <P>Title 49 of the United States Code, section 47105(f), provides that the sponsor of each airport to which funds are apportioned shall notify the Secretary by such time and in a form as prescribed by the Secretary, of the airport sponsor's intent to apply for its apportioned funds, also called entitlement funds. Therefore, the FAA is hereby notifying such airport sponsors of the steps required to ensure that the FAA has sufficient time to carry-over and convert remaining entitlement funds, due to processes required under federal laws. This notice applies only to those airports that have had entitlement funds apportioned to them, except those nonprimary airports located in designated block-grant States. Airport sponsors intending to apply for any of their available entitlement funds, including those unused from prior years, shall make their intent known by 12:00 p.m. prevailing local time on Monday, May 2, 2016, consistent with prior practice. A written indication must be provided to the designated Airports District Office (or Regional Office in regions without Airports District Offices) stating their intent to submit a grant application no later than close of business Friday, June 17, 2016 and to use their fiscal year 2016 entitlement funds available under Title 49 of the United States Code, section 47114. This notice must address all entitlement funds available to date for fiscal year 2016 including those entitlement funds not obligated from prior years. By Friday, June 17, 2016, airport sponsors that have not yet submitted a final application to the FAA, must notify the FAA of any issues meeting the final application deadline of Friday, July 1, 2016. Absent notification from the airport sponsor by the May 2 deadline and/or subsequent notification by the June 17 deadline of any issues meeting the application deadline, the FAA will proceed after Friday, July 1, 2016 to take action to carry-over the remainder of available entitlement funds without further notice. These funds will not be available <PRTPAGE P="22364"/>again until at least the beginning of fiscal year 2017. This notice is being issued later than usual in the fiscal year due to the timing of multiple extensions of the FAA's authorizing legislation. These dates are subject to possible adjustment based on any future extensions to the FAA's authorizing legislation which currently expires July 15, 2016.</P>
        <P>This notice is promulgated to expedite and facilitate the grant-making process.</P>
        <P>The AIP grant program is operating under the requirements of Public Law 114-55, the “Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2015,” enacted on September 30, 2015 and subsequently amended on March 30, 2016, which authorizes the FAA through July 15, 2016 and the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016” which appropriates FY 2016 funds for the AIP.</P>

        <P>The FAA invites public comment on the request to release approximately 15.9323± acres of airport property at The Des Moines International Airport (DSM) under the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 47107(h)(2). On February 19, 2015, the Director of Engineering &amp; Planning at The Des Moines International Airport requested from the FAA that approximately 15.9323± acres of property be released for sale to the Electro Management Corporation for use as a distribution warehouse consistent with the zoning ordinances of the City. On April 5, 2016, the FAA determined that the request to release property at The Des Moines International Airport (DSM) submitted by the Sponsor meets the procedural requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration and the release of the property does not and will not impact future aviation needs at the airport. The FAA may approve the request, in whole or in part, no sooner than thirty days after the publication of this notice.</P>
        <P>The following is a brief overview of the request: </P>
        <P>The Des Moines International Airport (DSM) is proposing the release of airport property totaling 15.9323 acres, more or less. This land is to be used for a distribution warehouse for the Electro Management Corporation. The release of land is necessary to comply with Federal Aviation Administration Grant Assurances that do not allow federally acquired airport property to be used for non-aviation purposes. The sale of the subject property will result in the land at The Des Moines International Airport (DSM) being changed from aeronautical to non-aeronautical use and release the lands from the conditions of the Airport Improvement Program Grant Agreement Grant Assurances. In accordance with 49 U.S.C. 47107(c)(2)(B)(i) and (iii), the airport will receive fair market value for the property, which will be subsequently reinvested in another eligible airport improvement project for general aviation facilities at The Des Moines International Airport.</P>

        <P>Any person may inspect, by appointment, the request in person at the FAA office listed above under <E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>. In addition, any person may, upon appointment and request, inspect the application, notice and other documents determined by the FAA to be related to the application in person at The Des Moines International Airport.</P>

        <P>The Final EA was prepared to analyze the potential environmental impacts of the FAA modifying the Alaska Aerospace Corporation's (AAC's) Launch Site Operator License to include medium-lift launch capability at the Kodiak Launch Complex (KLC), a commercial launch site currently operated under a FAA Launch Site Operator License (LSO-03-008), which authorizes only small-lift operations. The Kodiak Launch Complex was renamed as Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska, effective April 21, 2015. The EA keeps the name as KLC for continuity and ease of reviewing.</P>

        <P>Expansion of launch capabilities at KLC would include the addition of new infrastructure necessary to support <PRTPAGE P="22365"/>medium-lift launches, including the construction of a launch pad and associated facilities. As part of the Proposed Action addressed in the EA, AAC would make improvements to the KLC to add both solid and liquid-propellant, medium-lift launch capability, and to operate the KLC in the future as a small-lift and medium-lift launch complex. Proposed construction at KLC includes six primary modifications: Construction of Launch Pad 3 (LP3), a vehicle processing facility, rocket staging facility, liquid fuel facility, mission control center and improvements to Pasagshak Point Road. Proposed launch operations would include up to six orbital small-lift launches and three medium-lift launches per year from the existing launch pads and from the proposed LP3; however, to be conservative in the analysis of potential environmental impacts, the EA assumes a maximum of nine medium-lift launches per year.</P>
        <P>The EA addresses the potential environmental impacts of implementing the Proposed Action and the No Action Alternative. Under the No Action Alternative, the FAA would not modify AAC's Launch Site Operator License to include medium-lift launch capability and AAC would not proceed with the construction of medium-lift launch support infrastructure at KLC. Existing launch activities for up to nine orbital small-lift class launches per year from the existing launch pads would continue.</P>
        <P>The impact categories considered in the EA include air quality; compatible land use; Department of Transportation Act: Section 4(f); fish, wildlife, and plants; hazardous materials, pollution prevention, and solid waste; historical, architectural, archaeological, and cultural resources; light emissions and visual impacts; natural resources and energy supply; noise; socioeconomic, environmental justice, and children's environmental health and safety risk; water quality; and wetlands. The EA also considers potential cumulative environmental impacts.</P>

        <P>The FAA has posted the Final EA and FONSI/ROD on the FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation Web site: <E T="03">http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/environmental/nepa_docs/review/operator/.</E>
        </P>

        <P>The FAA published a Notice of Availability (NOA) of the Draft EA in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on September 15, 2014. An electronic version was also made available on the FAA Web site. In addition, the FAA printed and mailed a copy of the Draft EA to local libraries. The FAA held an open house public meeting on October 7, 2014. The public comment period for the Draft EA ended on November 1, 2014. After taking into consideration the nature of public comments received on the Draft EA, the FAA issued a Second Draft EA and provided the public with an opportunity to review and comment on updates and clarification information that had since been added to the EA in response to public comments. The FAA published a NOA of the Second Draft EA in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on December 7, 2015. Interested parties were invited to submit comments on the Second Draft EA by January 11, 2016. Public comments on the Second Draft EA resulted in minor changes to the EA.</P>

          <P>NHTSA is announcing a second public meeting to seek input on planned guidelines for the safe deployment and operation of automated vehicles. NHTSA held its first public meeting on this topic on April 8, 2016, in Washington, DC. The intent of the operational guidelines is to encourage innovative and safe deployment of automated vehicle technologies. At this meeting, NHTSA is seeking public input on those aspects of automated vehicle (AV) systems that would benefit from operational guidelines. For example, of high importance to the Agency is information on the roadway scenarios and operational environments highly automated vehicles will need to address and the associated design and evaluation processes and methods needed to ensure that AV systems can detect and appropriately react to these scenarios such that a high level of safety is assured when these systems are deployed on US roadways.</P>
          <P>Also of interest to the Agency is input on aspects of automated vehicle technology that may not be suitable or ready for guidelines. For these areas, information would be useful on alternative approaches to assure safety.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Public Meeting Topics</HD>
        <P>NHTSA is seeking input on the following topics during the morning and afternoon sessions of the meeting.</P>
        <P>1. <E T="03">Evaluation and testing of scenarios the AV system should detect and correctly operate in:</E> Within the AV system's operating envelope, consider how to identify the scenarios that could be encountered by the AV system (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> behavioral competencies/normal driving, pre-crash scenarios, etc.) and what design and evaluation (testing) processes and methods are needed to ensure that the vehicle can detect and appropriately react to these scenarios. Consider whether third party testing is appropriate for validating test results.</P>
        <P>2. <E T="03">Detection and communication of operational boundaries:</E> If there are limitations on where AV technology will operate—what methods should the AV technology use to sense when it is reaching the operational domain limit and how should that be communicated to the driver?</P>
        <P>3. <E T="03">Environmental operation and sensing:</E> Consider what environmental conditions AV systems will likely operate in. For environmental conditions in which AV systems are not designed to operate, discuss methods used to detect these conditions.</P>
        <P>4. <E T="03">Driver transitioning to/from AV operating mode:</E> For AV systems that rely on transferring vehicle operation back to the driver, discuss approaches to (a) ensuring safe transitioning back to a fully capable non-impaired driver (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> geo-fencing, adverse weather) and (b) how non-optimal driver behavior (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> decision errors, erratic behavior, driver impairment) will be addressed by the AV system.</P>
        <P>5. <E T="03">AV for persons with disabilities:</E> Consider the<E T="03"/> unique needs of people with different types of disabilities in the design, development, and policy setting for self-driving cars and related automation.</P>
        <P>6. <E T="03">Data:</E> Consider data recording capabilities of system(s) necessary to monitor the correct operation of the AV system, and what are appropriate triggers (crash, near crash, etc.) to determine system operational status or possible malfunction of the system. Also consider how recorded data could be accessed and by whom. During the testing phase, consider what data should be made public for further analysis and understanding.</P>
        <P>7. <E T="03">Crash avoidance capability:</E> Consider the capabilities of AV systems with respect to detecting roadway hazards (other vehicles, pedestrians, animals, etc.) such that common crash scenarios involving these hazards (control loss, crossing paths head-on, etc.) can be detected and either avoided or mitigated.</P>
        <P>8. <E T="03">Electronics systems safety:</E> Consider methods and potential documentation that could be produced with respect to functional safety and cybersecurity.</P>
        <P>9. <E T="03">Non-passenger AVs:</E> Consider differences between AVs designed for delivery of goods and products that are <PRTPAGE P="22367"/>not intended to have a human operator or potentially even human passengers.</P>
        <P>10. <E T="03">Aspects of AV technology that may not be suitable or ready for guidelines:</E> For these areas, information would be useful on alternative approaches to assure safety.</P>
        <P>11. <E T="03">Identification of industry voluntary standards, best practices, etc.,</E> related to automated vehicle operation.</P>
        <P>12. <E T="03">Information AVs may need to communicate to pedestrians and other vehicles (manual or automated) just as a driver would.</E> Consider situations such as pedestrians crossing a travel lane in a parking lot and how this communication should be accomplished.</P>
        <P>13. <E T="03">Conditions in which AVs may need to be able to identify and communicate to a central location or authority that a problem has occurred.</E> Consider situations where passengers may be delivered to their destination but a medical problem or potential incapacitation enroute may potentially suggest considerations for vehicle capabilities that could handle such cases.</P>
        <P>14. <E T="03">Operation of an AV with open safety recall:</E> Consider if automated vehicles should be allowed to operate in automated mode in cases when there is an open safety recall on that vehicle or if automated functions should be restrained until recall repairs are completed (perhaps reversion to manual driving when possible). Consider if AVs with open recalls should be allowed to operate on public roads at all, and if so, under what conditions.</P>
        <P>15. <E T="03">Other topics needed for operational guidance:</E> Other topics that would be beneficial to address in an operational guidance document to facilitate innovation and safe deployment of these systems on public roadways.</P>

        <P>This notice requests information to assist NHTSA in implementing a pilot grant program required under the FAST Act. <E T="03">See</E> Public Law 114-94, § 24105 (2015). The FAST Act requires that, by October 1, 2016, NHTSA must implement a two-year pilot program with up to six States to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a State process for informing consumers of open motor vehicle recalls at the time of motor vehicle registration. NHTSA plans to solicit grant applications following the receipt and consideration of comments and information submitted in response to this notice.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>

        <P>The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, 49 U.S.C. 30101 <E T="03">et. seq.</E> as amended, requires that a motor vehicle manufacturer notify the owners and purchasers of its vehicles of a safety-related defect or that the vehicle does not comply with an applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standard. 49 U.S.C. 30118. A vehicle manufacturer must provide notice of a recall in a manner prescribed through regulation by NHTSA to each person registered under State law as the owner and whose name and address are reasonably ascertainable by the manufacturer through State records or other available source or (if a registered owner is not notified through State registration information) to the most recent purchaser known to the manufacturer. 49 U.S.C. 30119(d). In order to identify owners of vehicles subject to a safety-related recall and provide notification to them, a motor vehicle manufacturer typically contracts with a third party that obtains vehicle registration data for the affected vehicles from State motor vehicle administrations. The motor vehicle manufacturer then notifies owners and purchasers, typically by U.S. Mail, about the safety recall and, among other things, about how to obtain a remedy to fix the defect. <E T="03">See</E> 49 U.S.C. 30119(d); 49 CFR part 577.</P>
        <P>NHTSA and the motor vehicle industry have sought to improve notice of safety-related defects to owners and to develop ways to increase the rate at which owners complete the remedy identified in the notice.<SU>1</SU>

          <FTREF/> Section 24105 of the recently enacted FAST Act provides for the two-year pilot program to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a State process for informing consumers of open motor vehicle recalls at the time of motor vehicle registration in the State. To carry out this program, the FAST Act permits NHTSA to make a grant to up to six States. To be eligible for a grant, the Act requires a State to: (i) Submit an <PRTPAGE P="22368"/>application in such form and manner as the Secretary prescribes; (ii) agree to notify, at the time of registration, each owner or lessee of a motor vehicle presented for registration in the State of any open recall on that vehicle; (iii) provide the open motor vehicle recall information at no cost to each owner or lessee of a motor vehicle presented for registration in the State; and (iv) provide such other information as the Secretary may require.</P>
        <FTNT>
          <P>

            <SU>1</SU> In April 2015, NHTSA hosted a workshop called “Retooling Recalls” to explore ways to increase recall remedy completion rates. See <E T="03">http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/2015/nhtsa-retooling-recalls-workshop-04282015.</E> Recently, the agency published an ANPRM requesting public comment on, among other things, additional ways by which manufacturers could not only notify owners, but also influence owners to have recalls completed. <E T="03">See</E> 81 FR 81 FR 4007 (January 25, 2016).</P>
        </FTNT>
        <P>In considering a State for a grant under this provision, the FAST Act requires NHTSA to consider the State's methodology for determining open recalls on a motor vehicle, for informing consumers of the open recalls, and for determining performance. Following the two-year performance period, the FAST Act requires that the State grantee provide to NHTSA a report of performance containing information necessary to evaluate the extent to which open recalls have been remedied. Within six months after the completion of the pilot program, the FAST Act requires NHTSA to evaluate the extent to which identified open recalls have been remedied.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Request for Information</HD>
        <P>The agency is interested in information that would be helpful in implementing a successful pilot grant. This includes information about, among other things: A State's process for registering motor vehicles; the application(s) in use by the States to facilitate its access to open recall data and to notify consumers; how a notice to consumers should be provided to raise awareness of the open recall; performance criteria; and the estimated costs for a State to fulfill the pilot program requirements. Because the FAST Act requires NHTSA to consider a State's methodology for determining performance, the agency is interested in comments from parties on how to determine such performance, including ways to measure whether a consumer had a defect remedied following notification of an open recall, and metrics for comparing pre-pilot and post-pilot performance. The agency is also interested in hearing from States, based upon the current status of their vehicle registration systems, about the requirements and challenges to adapt their systems to conduct the pilot program. And, because Congress requires NHTSA to evaluate the pilot program, we seek information and suggestions about how to ensure a successful assessment.</P>
        <P>In addition to the topics discussed above, we seek information related to the questions posed below. This list is not exhaustive, and we encourage commenters to provide any further information they believe is relevant to inform the agency as it seeks to implement a successful pilot program. While the agency welcomes all comments, we do not envision the use of NHTSA's VIN look-up tool as a source of information for the pilot program. The VIN look-up tool was created for consumers. An increase in the demand on NHTSA's VIN look-up tool from a large enterprise submitting numerous queries could compromise its performance for its intended purpose.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">Registration Process</HD>
        <P>• How often do States require a vehicle to be registered?</P>
        <P>• What mechanisms exist for an owner to register a vehicle with the State? In-person, On-line? Mail-in?</P>

        <P>• What other conditions or requirements exist in connection with the registration process in a State (<E T="03">e.g.</E> vehicle emissions or safety inspection)?</P>
        <P>• If additional conditions or requirements exist, how are they linked to the vehicle registration process? Would the systems that link to the vehicle registration process be available for the pilot program? What modifications might be required?</P>

          <P>In accordance with 24 CFR part 581 and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in <E T="03">National Coalition for the Homeless</E> v. <E T="03">Veterans Administration,</E> No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).</P>
          <P>Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable, and suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.</P>
          <P>Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from the date of this Notice. Where property is described as for “off-site use only” recipients of the property will be required to relocate the building to their own site at their own expense. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression of interest to HHS, addressed to: Ms. Theresa M. Ritta, Chief Real Property Branch, the Department of Health and Human Services, Room 5B-17, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, (301)-443-2265 (This is not a toll-free number.) HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications, the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 24 CFR part 581.</P>
          <P>For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.</P>
          <P>For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.</P>

          <P>Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Ann Marie Oliva at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property address (including zip code), the date of publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>, the landholding agency, and the property number.</P>

          <P>For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> acreage, floor plan, existing sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate landholding agencies at the following addresses: <E T="03">Air Force:</E> Mr. Robert E. Moriarty, P.E., AFCEC/CI, 2261 Hughes Avenue, Ste. 155, JBSA Lackland TX 78236-9853; <E T="03">Army:</E> Ms. Veronica Rines, Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management, Department of Army, Room 5A128, 600 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 20310, (571)-256-8145; (These are not toll-free numbers).</P>

          <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
          <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
          <FP>The Sewall-Belmont House (House), located at 144 Constitution Avenue, Northeast, in Washington, D.C.—a few steps from the U.S. Capitol—has been home to the National Woman's Party (NWP) since 1929. From this House, the NWP's founder Alice Paul wrote new language in 1943 for the Equal Rights Amendment, which became known as the “Alice Paul Amendment,” and led the fight for its passage in the Congress. From here, throughout the 20th century, Paul and the NWP drafted more than 600 pieces of legislation in support of equal rights and advocated tirelessly for women's political, social, and economic equality not just in the United States but also internationally.</FP>
          <FP>While the House's role in women's history makes it a nationally significant resource, the building itself has an interesting past. Robert Sewall constructed the House on Jenkins Hill, known today as Capitol Hill, around 1800. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin used the House during the Jefferson Administration, and the House was the site of the only resistance to the British invasion of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812. In retaliation, the British set fire to the House, but by 1820, Sewall had rebuilt it. The House remained in the Sewall family until 1922, when it was acquired by Vermont Senator Porter Dale.</FP>
          <FP>The NWP purchased the House in 1929 to serve as its headquarters. The NWP named it the “Alva Belmont House” in honor of its former president and major benefactor who had helped purchase the NWP's previous headquarters. A prominent suffragist herself, Belmont said of the new headquarters, “may it stand for years and years to come, telling of the work that the women of the United States have accomplished; the example we have given foreign nations; and our determination that they shall be—as ourselves—free citizens, recognized as the equals of men.” What is now called the Sewall-Belmont House became the staging ground for the NWP's advocacy for an equal rights amendment and other significant domestic and international action for women's equality.</FP>
          <FP>Alice Paul, the women's suffrage and equal rights leader closely associated with the Sewall-Belmont House, led the NWP from its headquarters at the House from 1929 to 1972. A Quaker and well educated, before her work in the United States, Paul had been inspired by the women's suffrage movement in Britain in the early 20th century. During her years there from 1907 to 1910, she joined with Emmeline Pankhurst, her daughters, and other suffragettes to secure the vote for British women. Paul's participation in meetings, demonstrations, and depositions to Parliament led to multiple arrests, hunger strikes, and force-feedings.</FP>

          <FP>Paul brought home her focus on women's suffrage when she returned to the United States in 1910. After earning a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1912, she devoted herself to the American suffrage movement. She feared that the movement was waning at the national level because efforts had shifted to State suffrage. Paul believed that the movement <PRTPAGE P="22506"/>needed to concentrate on the passage of a Federal suffrage amendment to the United States Constitution.</FP>
          <FP>Paul became a member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and by 1912 served as the chair of its Congressional Committee in Washington, D.C. In 1913, she and Lucy Burns created a larger organization, the Congressional Union of Woman Suffrage, which soon disagreed with NAWSA over tactics. The Congressional Union split from NAWSA in 1914 and evolved into the NWP through steps taken in 1916 and 1917.</FP>
          <FP>Paul was the most prominent figure in the final phase of the battle for the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1920, granting women the right to vote. As part of her strategy, she adopted the philosophy to “hold the party in power responsible” from her work on women's suffrage in Britain. The NWP withheld its support from the existing political parties until women gained the right to vote, and “punished” those parties in power that did not support suffrage. In 1913, the day before Woodrow Wilson's first inauguration, Paul organized a women's suffrage parade of more than 5,000 participants from every State in the Union. Through a series of dramatic nonviolent protests, the NWP demanded that President Wilson and the Congress address women's issues. The NWP organized “Silent Sentinels” to stand outside the White House holding banners inscribed with incendiary phrases directed toward President Wilson. The colorful, spirited suffrage marches, the suffrage songs, the violence the women faced as they were physically attacked and had their banners torn from their hands, the daily pickets and arrests at the White House, the recurring jail time, the hunger strikes which resulted in force-feedings and brutal prison conditions, the national speaking tours, and newspaper headlines all created enormous public support for suffrage.</FP>
          <FP>Through most of the last century, the NWP remained a leading advocate of women's political, social, and economic equality. Following ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, the NWP, under the leadership of Alice Paul, turned its attention towards the larger issue of complete equality of men and women under the law. Paul reorganized the NWP in 1922 to focus on eliminating all discrimination against women. In 1923, at the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, Paul proposed an equal rights amendment to the Constitution, which became known as the “Lucretia Mott Amendment,” and launched the campaign to win full equality for women. In 1943, Alice Paul rewrote the amendment, which then became known as the “Alice Paul Amendment.” What we now refer to as the “Equal Rights Amendment” was introduced in every session of Congress from 1923 until it finally passed in 1972, though it still has not been ratified by the required majority: three-fourths of the States.</FP>

          <FP>Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the NWP drafted more than 600 pieces of legislation in support of equal rights for women on the State and local levels, including bills covering divorce and custody rights, jury service, property rights, ability to enter into contracts, and the retention of one's maiden name after marriage. It launched two major “Women for Congress” campaigns in 1924 and 1926 and lobbied for the appointment of women to high Federal positions. The NWP also worked for Federal and State “blanket bills” to ensure women equal rights and helped change Federal laws to equalize nationality and citizenship laws for women. The NWP fought successfully for the repeal of a statute that prohibited Federal employees from working for the Federal Government if their spouses also were Federal employees. The NWP helped eliminate many of the sex discrimination clauses in the “codes of fair competition” established under the New Deal's National Recovery Administration, and assisted in the adoption of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Paul and the NWP also played a role in getting language protecting women included in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<PRTPAGE P="22507"/>
          </FP>
          <FP>Alice Paul and the NWP did not limit their fight for women's rights to domestic arenas but also became active in international feminism as early as the 1920s. Among other actions, in 1938 Paul formed the World Woman's Party, which served as the NWP's international organization. It first assisted Jewish women fleeing the Holocaust and then became the NWP's office for promoting equal rights for women around the world. The NWP helped both Puerto Rican and Cuban women in seeking the vote, and in 1945 advocated successfully for the incorporation of language on women's equality in the United Nations Charter and for the establishment of a permanent United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.</FP>
          <FP>The political strategies and tactics of Alice Paul and the NWP became a blueprint for civil rights organizations and activities throughout the 20th century. In 1997, the NWP ceased to be a lobbying organization and became a non-profit, educational organization. Today, the House tells the story of a century of courageous activism by American women.</FP>
          <FP>WHEREAS, section 320301 of title 54, United States Code (known as the “Antiquities Act”), authorizes the President, in the President's discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments, and to reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected;</FP>
          <FP>WHEREAS, in 1974, the Secretary of the Interior designated the Sewall-Belmont House a National Historic Landmark for its association with Alice Paul, the NWP, and the fight for equal rights, and later the same year the Congress enacted legislation creating the Sewall-Belmont House National Historic Site, an affiliated area of the National Park System;</FP>
          <FP>WHEREAS, the National Park Service completed a study in November 2014, which recommended that the Sewall-Belmont House become a unit of the National Park System and operate through cooperative management between the National Park Service and the NWP;</FP>
          <FP>WHEREAS, for the purpose of establishing a national monument to be administered by the National Park Service, the NWP has donated to the Federal Government fee title to the Sewall-Belmont House and the approximately 0.34 acres of land on which it is located;</FP>
          <FP>WHEREAS, the National Park Service and the NWP agree that the NWP should continue to own and manage its collection, which includes an extensive library and archival and museum holdings relating to the women's movement, and the NWP has indicated its intention to enter into appropriate arrangements with the National Park Service that would further the preservation of the permanent collection at the Sewall-Belmont House and provide for cooperative interpretation and management activities with the National Park Service;</FP>
          <FP>WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to preserve and protect the Sewall-Belmont House and the historic objects associated with it;</FP>

          <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 320301 of title 54, United States Code, hereby proclaim the objects identified above that are situated upon lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument (monument) and, for the purpose of protecting those objects, reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. The reserved Federal lands and interests in lands encompass approximately 0.34 acres. The boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.<PRTPAGE P="22508"/>
          </FP>
          <FP>All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries described on the accompanying map are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws, from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.</FP>
          <FP>The establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights.</FP>
          <FP>The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall manage the monument through the National Park Service, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, consistent with the purposes and provisions of this proclamation. The Secretary shall prepare a management plan, with full public involvement and in coordination with the NWP, within 3 years of the date of this proclamation. The management plan shall ensure that the monument fulfills the following purposes for the benefit of present and future generations: (1) to preserve and protect the objects of historic interest associated with the monument, and (2) to interpret the monument's objects, resources, and values related to the women's rights movement. The management plan shall, among other things, set forth the desired relationship of the monument to other related resources, programs, and organizations, both within and outside the National Park System.</FP>
          <FP>The National Park Service is directed to use applicable authorities to seek to enter into agreements with others, and the NWP in particular, to address common interests and promote management efficiencies, including provision of visitor services, interpretation and education, establishment and care of museum collections, and preservation of historic objects.</FP>
          <FP>Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the monument shall be the dominant reservation.</FP>
          <FP>Warning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.</FP>
          <FP>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.</FP>
