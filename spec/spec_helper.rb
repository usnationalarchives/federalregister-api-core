    # == Fixtures
    #
    # You can declare fixtures for each example_group like this:
    #   describe "...." do
    #     fixtures :table_a, :table_b
    #
    # Alternatively, if you prefer to declare them only once, you can
    # do so right here. Just uncomment the next line and replace the fixture
    # names with your fixtures.
    #
    # config.global_fixtures = :table_a, :table_b
    #
    # If you declare global fixtures, be aware that they will be declared
    # for all of your examples, even those that don't use them.
    #
    # You can also declare which fixtures to use (for example fixtures for test/fixtures):
    #
    # config.fixture_path = RAILS_ROOT + '/spec/fixtures/'
    #
    # == Mock Framework
    #
    # RSpec uses its own mocking framework by default. If you prefer to
    # use mocha, flexmock or RR, uncomment the appropriate line:
    #
    # config.mock_with :mocha
    # config.mock_with :flexmock
    # config.mock_with :rr
    #
    # == Notes

    # For more information take a look at Spec::Runner::Configuration and Spec::Runner
