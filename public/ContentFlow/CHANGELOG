version 1.0 (2010/02/09)
-------------------------
 
 Beware: Because of a major restructuring, this release will break with older

         defined your own calculation methods (calcSize, calcCoordinates, 
         calcRelativeItemPosition, calcZIndex or calcFontSize) you have to 
         rework them.
         If you use AddOns please update to the new version of the AddOn.

 * moved to relative return values for the following methods:
   calcSize := returns values ranging from 0.0 - 1.0
   calcCoordinates := returns values ranging from -1.0 to 1.0
   calcRelativeItemPosition := returns values ranging from -1.0 to 1.0

 * changed the paramters of the following methods:
   calcStepWidth   : ( diff )
   calcSize        : ( item ) 
   calcCoordinates : ( item ) 
   calcRelativeItemPosition : ( item ) 
   calcZIndex      : ( item ) 
   calcFontSize    : ( item )

version 0.7 (2009/04/09)
------------------------

         defined your own methods (i.e. calcCoordinates or onclickActiveItem) 
         you have to move the definitions into the configuration object.
         If you use AddOns please update to the new version of the AddOn.

         In any other case you can use the new version without any modification.
