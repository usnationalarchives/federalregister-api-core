-                    The draft guidance describes approaches that sponsors should use to develop potency assay methods for release and stability that assess comprehensively known or potential mechanism(s) of action of the product. The sensitivity of these methods must be established, for example, to conduct the appropriate laboratory determination of satisfactory conformance to final specifications for the drug product (

In addition to release and stability methods, other methods that demonstrate the biological function(s) of the product may be needed for characterization and comparability studies. The draft guidance describes methods that sponsors should use to ensure the potency of mAbs and other therapeutic proteins proposed to prevent or treat a viral infection.

-                    In January 2021, FDA published the guidance for industry entitled “COVID–19: Potency Assay Considerations for Monoclonal Antibodies and Other Therapeutic Proteins Targeting SARS–CoV–2 Infectivity” (available at 
-                    <E T="03">https://www.fda.gov/media/145128/download</E>
-                    ) to support public health efforts following a declaration, under section 319 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 247d), by the Secretary of Health and Human Services of a public health emergency related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (the disease caused by SARS–CoV–2) (section 319 public health emergency). The 2021 guidance focuses solely on addressing potency assays as they relate to mAbs and other therapeutic proteins that directly target SARS–CoV–2, and it is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the section 319 public health emergency related to Coronavirus Disease 2019. However, FDA believes that many of the recommendations set forth in the 2021 guidance are applicable outside the context of the section 319 public health emergency and are applicable to mAbs and other therapeutic proteins directly targeting any viral surface (glyco)proteins mediating pathogenic mechanisms of infection, not just those that directly target SARS–CoV–2. FDA is, therefore, issuing this draft guidance. In preparing this guidance, FDA considered comments received regarding the 2021 guidance as well as the Agency's experience with SARS–CoV–2 and other viruses.

-                <P>This draft guidance is being issued consistent with FDA's good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on “Potency Assay Considerations for Monoclonal Antibodies and Other Therapeutic Proteins Targeting Viral Pathogens.” It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.</P>

-                     The C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program was established by the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 (Public Law [Pub. L.] 109–129) and was reauthorized in 2010 (Pub. L. 111–264), 2015 (Pub. L. 114–104) and again in 2021 (Pub. L. 117–15). The C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program's Office of Patient Advocacy (OPA) is operated by the National Marrow Donor Program® (NMDP). Through OPA, NMDP provides navigation services, education resources and support to people in need of or who have received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). As the contractor for the OPA, NMDP is required to conduct surveys to evaluate patient satisfaction with the services provided. As such, NMDP will elicit feedback from HCT patients, caregivers, and family members who had contact with the NMDP/Be The Match® Patient Support Center (PSC) for service and support. The survey is administered through a web-based system. In addition to questions that measure satisfaction, the survey also includes demographic questions to determine representativeness of findings.

-                    <E T="03">Need and Proposed Use of the Information:</E>
-                     HCT is a complex medical procedure that requires significant support before, during and after the procedure. Many patients experience barriers that impede access to HCT. Barriers to HCT-related care and educational information are multi-factorial. The NMDP/Be The Match PSC offers many programs and services to support patients, caregivers, and family members throughout their HCT journey. Feedback from recipients of NMDP services is essential to understand the changing needs for services and information as well as to demonstrate the effectiveness of existing services. The primary use for information gathered through the survey is to determine the helpfulness of participants' initial contact with the PSC patient navigators and to identify areas for improvement in the delivery of services. Patient navigators are trained 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13131"/>
-                    lay or licensed clinical patient navigators, who respond to requests for information and support. Program managers and NMDP leadership use this evaluation data to share patients' experiences as well as make program and resource allocation decisions.
-                </P>
-                <P>Web-based surveys will be administered to all participants (patients, caregivers, and family members) who have contact with the PSC. All participants for whom an email address is known will be invited to complete the survey online. Survey respondents will be notified via email invitation and in the survey instructions that participation is voluntary, and responses will be kept confidential. A follow-up invitation will be sent within 2 weeks to non-respondents.</P>
-                <P>The survey will include these items to measure: (1) their experience, (2) if the contact helped the participant feel more confident in coping with treatment, (3) if the contact helped the participant feel more hopeful, (4) if the contact helped the participant feel less alone, (5) increased awareness of available resources, (6) if the contact helped the participant feel more informed about treatment options, (7) if their questions were answered, and (8) types of challenges faced by participant. The survey data will be analyzed quarterly and annually, and results will be shared with program managers. Feedback indicating a need for improvement will be reviewed by program managers biannually and implementation of resulting program changes or additions will be documented.</P>
-                <P>
-                    <E T="03">Likely Respondents:</E>
-                     Respondents will include patients, caregivers, and family members who have contact with the PSC via phone or email for HCT navigation services and support (advocacy). The decision to survey all participants was made based on the historically low response rate to this survey due to patients' frequent transitions in health status as well as transfer between home and the hospital for initial treatment and care for complications. Participants will receive the survey once in a 1-year cycle. If a participant contacts the PSC one or more years after the initial contact, they will receive a second survey. This is because we anticipate that the participants' needs will likely change during the time lapse.

-                    <E T="03">Burden Statement:</E>
-                     Burden in this context means the time expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, disclose, or provide the information requested. This includes the time needed to review instructions; to develop, acquire, install, and utilize technology and systems for the purpose of collecting, validating, and verifying information, processing and maintaining information, and disclosing and providing information; to train personnel and to be able to respond to a collection of information; to search data sources; to complete and review the collection of information; and to transmit or otherwise disclose the information. The total annual burden hours estimated for this ICR are summarized in the table below.
-                </P>
-                <P>The total respondent burden for the customer satisfaction surveys is estimated to be 153 hours. HRSA expects a total of 900 respondents to complete the Be The Match® Patient Support Center Survey.</P>

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121

While that work is ongoing, and in an effort to implement the plain terms of the 2022 Act as quickly as possible, USCIS will begin collecting the fee for fiscal year 2023, which under the 2022 Act would have been due on October 1, 2022, on March 2, 2023. USCIS will accept payment of the fee, as required by the statute, for 30 days. For fiscal year 2024 and each year thereafter, such fees are required to be paid between October 1st and October 31st of the same year.

-                    The 2022 Act sets the standard annual fee at $20,000 for each designated regional center. However, for those with “20 or fewer total investors in its new commercial enterprises” during the preceding fiscal year (October 1–September 30), the annual fee is reduced to $10,000. 
-                    <E T="03">Id.</E>
-                </P>
-                <P>At this time, given the statutory mandate to collect the fees beginning on October 1, 2022, and limited agency resources, USCIS is utilizing its discretion to set an enforcement policy for how it will evaluate whether a regional center has appropriately counted the number of its total investors and thus paid the correct fee. As a general matter, USCIS adjudicators will evaluate on a case-by-case basis how many investors a regional center has in any given fiscal year. However, adjudicators will engage in that case-by-case analysis with the understanding that, generally speaking, the number of investors for purpose of calculating the fee to be paid will be the total number of EB–5 investors who have invested (or are actively in the process of investing) in all of the regional center's new commercial enterprises in the respective fiscal year. This policy is drawn as closely to the plain statutory language as possible and is in line with the general understanding of the term “investors” by EB–5 stakeholders.</P>
-                <P>
-                    Although “investor” is not specifically defined for purposes of INA section 203(b)(5), 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5), it is used extensively throughout that section to refer to noncitizens seeking classification, or classified, under INA section 203(b)(5) 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5) (
-                    <E T="03">i.e.</E>
-                     I–526 and I–526E petitioners). For purposes of INA section 216A, “alien investor” is defined as “an alien who obtains the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence (whether on a conditional basis or otherwise)” under INA section 203(b)(5), 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5). 
-                    <E T="03">See</E>

-                </P>
-                <P>
-                    USCIS recognizes that there is no legal requirement that an investor remain invested in an NCE within a specific time period after they file their Form I–829, 
-                    <E T="03">Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status,</E>
-                     and thus has determined that the filing of the Form I–829 generally would be an appropriate demarcation for purposes of determining the number of “total investors in the preceding fiscal year.” Based on INA sections 203(b)(5) and 216A(f)(1), USCIS generally considers an individual to be an investor from the point of filing a petition for classification (Form I–526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur, or Forms I–526E, Immigrant Petition by Regional Center Investor) through the point of filing a petition for removal of conditions (Form I–829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status). This is also the general understanding of the term amongst EB–5 stakeholders.

-                     Thus, subject to additional considerations described below, USCIS intends to estimate the approximate number of total investors in a regional center in any given fiscal year by subtracting the number of Forms I–829 associated with the regional center filed at any time on or before September 30 of that fiscal year (including filings from prior fiscal years) from the total number of pending and approved Forms I–526,

-                     (filed on or after June 1, 2022 (the date USCIS published the form)) associated with the regional center filed at any time on or before September 30 of that same fiscal year (including filings from prior fiscal years). A Form I–829 that is filed separately by a spouse or child of an investor that obtained conditional permanent resident status based on their relationship to the investor and was not included on the principal investor's Form I–829 may typically be excluded from the total investor calculation. For example, if a regional center had 30 associated Form I–526 petitions, 10 associated Form I–526E petitions and 20 associated Form I–829 petitions filed on or before September 30, 2022, USCIS generally would estimate that the

-                <P>USCIS recognizes that there may be alternative methods of calculating “total investors” and has considered potential reliance interests in arriving at this interpretation. As this is an entirely new statutorily created and mandated fee, and USCIS thus has not previously enforced this requirement, USCIS believes that regional centers likely do not have appreciable reliance interests that favor a given interpretation. USCIS emphasizes that the method of approximating investors described above is meant to be a general guide to USCIS adjudicators in this calculation. USCIS adjudicators retain discretion to evaluate the Integrity Fund fee due and the number of investors on a case-by-case basis, accounting for any other facts or evidence in the record in the totality of the circumstances, including any evidence provided by a regional center that believes it has greater or fewer total investors.</P>
-                <P>
-                    USCIS considered alternative methods of calculating when a noncitizen generally would no longer be deemed an “investor”; however, those options generally would either not capture the entire population or involve manual calculations that USCIS believes would place an unreasonable burden on the Agency's limited resources as USCIS works to implement the 2022 Act. Additionally, those options might be confusing and burdensome to the investor or regional center populations. For example, USCIS considered generally counting only the Forms I–526 that were filed within two years of the applicable period used for determining the EB–5 Integrity Fund fee given the expected two-year minimum timeframe for the investment, or sustainment period, under the 2022 Act. INA section 203(b)(5)(A)(i); 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)(A)(i). However, that would likely be underinclusive given that many investors are actively in the process of investing (
-                    <E T="03">i.e.</E>
-                     not yet fully invested) when they file their Form I–526 petition as permitted under applicable requirements and, additionally, would not align with the sustainment period for those who filed prior to the 2022 Act, which runs approximately to the point of the Form I–829 filing, regardless of when they filed their Form I–526 or made their investment. For Form I–526 petitions filed after the 2022 Act, USCIS also considered generally counting only Form I–526 petitions whose investments were still within the two-year period of investment expected under INA 203(b)(5)(A)(i); however, manual verification of the time period of investment for each regional center investor, rather than conducting a systems inquiry for total petition filings, would exhaust valuable and significant USCIS resources that the agency believes, in the balance, are better utilized in service of other adjudicatory priorities. USCIS acknowledges the practical limitations of determining how many “total investors” may be in a new commercial enterprise during any given fiscal year to ensure that the correct fee is paid. We believe the general method we are announcing in this notice, subject to case-by-case analysis, reflects both a reasonable interpretation of the statute and ensures that USCIS' limited resources are used most efficiently to ensure compliance with the 2022 Act.

INA section 203(b)(5)(J)(iv), 8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)(J)(iv). USCIS must terminate the designation of any regional center that does not pay the fee within 90 days after the date on which such fee is due.

-                </P>
-                <P>DHS has decided, in exercising its discretionary enforcement authority articulated above, that USCIS will not charge the late penalty in 2022 for the following reasons: (1) the Fund and Integrity Fund fee are new program requirements; and (2) USCIS must determine an amount that is a “reasonable” penalty to charge. Therefore, DHS has decided and USCIS is announcing that, as a matter of discretionary enforcement policy, we will not charge a late fee until we take further action to set the amount of the late fee, as well as the process for collecting the late fee.</P>
-                <P>
-                    However, USCIS will, as authorized by the 2022 Act, terminate the designation of any regional center that does not pay the full fee within 90 days after the date on which such fee is due (
-                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
-                     a regional center does not make payment, or a regional center pays $10,000 when it owes $20,000). Termination will not be automatic and USCIS will provide a notice of intent to terminate and the opportunity for a regional center to prove that the fee was paid in the proper amount by the due date before sending a notice of termination. Again, USCIS recognizes that the 2022 Act requires collection of the fee on October 1, 2022 and imposition of termination after 90-days. Because this notice published after October 1, 2022, USCIS will maintain the statutory 90-day termination period and will not begin taking steps to terminate a regional center until May 31, 2023. For all subsequent years, USCIS will take steps to terminate the regional center if the regional center

Ultimately, DHS decided that the discretionary policy of non-enforcement presented in this Notice was the most equitable path forward.

To the extent that there is minimal ambiguity regarding the calculation of “total investors” because the statute does not explicitly include a calculation, USCIS's interpretation is only intended to guide adjudicators in the performance of their duties and not remove their discretion in making adjudicatory decisions. This interpretation does not create any substantive or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable, because the fees are explicitly provided for in statute; but rather provides notice to the public regarding this explicit statutory fee requirement. USCIS imposes no additional duties or rights, beyond what the 2022 Act has already imposed.</P>

-                <P>BIE's Student Enrollment Application is utilized by schools operated or funded by BIE. The information is collected by school registrars to determine the student's eligibility for enrollment in a bureau-operated school, and if eligible, is shared with appropriate school officials to identify the student's base and supplemental educational and/or residential program needs. The information is compiled into a national database by the Bureau of Indian Education to facilitate budget requests and the allocation of congressionally appropriated funds.</P>
-                <P>BIE's Behavioral Health and Wellness Program (BHWP) is focused on providing indigenous focused, evidence-based, and trauma-informed behavioral health and wellness services/resources for students and staff at all Bureau-funded programs, departments, and institutions including Bureau operated schools, Tribally controlled schools, post-secondary institutions, and Tribal colleges and universities.</P>

-                <P>The 108 cultural items were removed from several sites in Amador County, CA, all of which are cataloged under accession number 81–95. In 1959 and through the early 1960s, Jerald Johnson, Patti Palumbo, Louis Payen, Lynn Kauffman, David Boloyan, Hansen, Gorman, and unnamed students of California State University, Sacramento collected various cultural items from CA–AMA–06, AMA–07, AMA–21, AMA–25, AMA–41, AMA–51, AMA–53, AMA–65, AMA–67, AMA–78, AMA–96, AMA–97, AMA–105, AMA–255, and four sites with no known trinomial: unnamed site, Rabbit Creek, Wrapped Stick Cave, and 3–118. All collections were curated at California State University, Sacramento. The 108 objects of cultural patrimony include faunal and flora remains, flaked and ground stone objects, historic objects, modified stone and wood, ochre, and thermally altered rocks.</P>

-                <P>The cultural items in this notice are connected to one or more identifiable earlier groups, tribes, peoples, or cultures. There is a relationship of shared group identity between the identifiable earlier groups, tribes, peoples, or cultures and one or more Indian Tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. The following types of information were used to reasonably trace the relationship: anthropological, archeological, geographical, historical, kinship, linguistic, oral, traditional, and expert opinion.</P>
-                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Determinations</HD>
-                <P>Pursuant to NAGPRA and its implementing regulations, and after consultation with the appropriate Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations, the California State University, Sacramento has determined that:</P>
-                <P>• The 108 cultural items described above have ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural importance central to the Native American group or culture itself, rather than property owned by an individual.</P>
-                <P>• There is a relationship of shared group identity that can be reasonably traced between the cultural items and the Buena Vista Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians of California.</P>

Requests for joint repatriation of the cultural items are considered a single request and not competing requests. The California State University, Sacramento is responsible for sending a copy of this notice to the Indian Tribe identified in this notice.</P>

-                <P>The 61 cultural items were removed from three sites in Yolo County, CA. Sometime in the 1950s, cultural items were removed from CA–YOL–16 (also known as the Kuchler Site) by students at Sacramento State College (now California State University, Sacramento) under the direction of Dr. Reeves. At all times thereafter, the collection has been housed at California State University, Sacramento. In 1966, cultural items were removed from CA–YOL–71 by Harry Hanson. How this collection came into the possession of California State University, Sacramento is unknown. In 1973, cultural items were found during a survey of unknown sites in the Capay Valley. How this collection came into the possession of California State University, Sacramento is unknown. In total there are 61 unassociated funerary objects, of which six objects are currently missing from the collections. The 61 unassociated funerary objects include faunal and floral remains; flaked and ground stone; historic period materials; and modified bones, shells, and stones. California State University, Sacramento continues to look for the six missing objects.</P>

-                    In 1965, human remains representing, at minimum, one individual were removed from site CA–SAC–113 (known, variously, as Calhoun #1, Calquhoun 1, and 
-                    <E T="03">Sukididi</E>
-                    ) in Sacramento County, CA, by Dr. William Beeson for Sacramento State College (now California State University, Sacramento). Occupation of site SAC–113 is estimated to have occurred during the Late Horizon, with possible use during the Historic period. No known individual was identified. The 323 associated funerary objects include baked clay; faunal remains; flaked and ground stone; historic material; and modified bone, stone, and shell. Of this number, 129 objects are currently missing from the collection. California State University, Sacramento continues to look for these 129 missing objects.

-                    In 1967 and 1972–73, human remains representing, at minimum, 378 individuals were removed from site CA–SAC–127 (known, variously, as Augustine Mound, Rooney Site, and 
-                    <E T="03">Oo'Le-Waymah</E>
-                    ), which is located along Deer Creek in Sacramento County, CA. The 1967 excavations, located in a cemetery area known as the Rooney Extension, were led by William Beeson and Mark Grady for Sacramento State College (now California State University, Sacramento). The 1972–73 excavations, located in an area adjacent to the cemetery, were led by Jerald Johnson for Sacramento State College (now California State University, Sacramento). The landowner, Rooney Brothers, Inc., gifted the collections to Sacramento State. Occupation of the site is estimated to range from the Middle Horizon through Historic periods. The 24,850 associated funerary objects include baked clay; faunal and floral remains; flaked and ground stones; historic materials; modified shells, bones, stone, and wood; non-cultural items; soil samples; ash; charcoal; pigment; unidentified materials; unmodified stone; and thermally altered rock. Of this number, 136 objects are currently missing from the collection. California State University, Sacramento continues to look for these 136 missing objects.

-                <P>DOL, as part of continuing efforts to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance consultation program to provide the general public and Federal agencies an opportunity to comment on proposed and/or continuing collections of information before submitting them to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for final approval. This program helps to ensure requested data can be provided in the desired format, reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized, collection instruments are clearly understood, and the impact of collection requirements can be properly assessed.</P>
-                <P>Pursuant to 20 CFR 653.109, State Workforce Agencies (SWA) use ETA Form 5148 to submit to DOL quarterly data on the services they provide to MSFWs. DOL uses that data to monitor and measure the extent and effectiveness of SWA service delivery to MSFWs and overall compliance with 20 CFR 651, 653, and 658. SWAs use the Complaint/Apparent Violation Form, ETA Form 8429 to record and process complaints.</P>

-                    This information collection is subject to the PRA. A Federal agency generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and the public is generally not required to respond to an information collection, unless it is approved by OMB under the PRA and displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no person shall generally be subject to penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information that does not display a valid Control Number.

-                <P>
-                    The Department of Labor, as part of the continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent (
-                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
-                     employer) burden, conducts a preclearance consultation program to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on proposed and continuing information collection requirements in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)). This program ensures that information is in the desired format, reporting burden (time and costs) is minimal, collection instruments are clearly understood, and OSHA's estimate of the information collection burden is accurate. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) (29 U.S.C. 651, 
-                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
-                    ) authorizes information collection by employers as necessary or appropriate for enforcement of the OSH Act or for developing information regarding the causes and prevention of occupational injuries, illnesses, and accidents (29 U.S.C. 657). The OSH Act also requires that OSHA obtain such information with minimum burden upon employers, especially those operating small businesses, and to reduce to the maximum extent feasible unnecessary duplication of effort in obtaining information (29 U.S.C. 657).
-                </P>
-                <P>The Hexavalent Chromium Standards for General Industry (29 CFR 1910.1026), Shipyard Employment (29 CFR 1915.1026), and Construction (29 CFR 1926.1126) (the standards) protect workers from the adverse health effects that may result from occupational exposure to hexavalent chromium. The major information collection requirements in the standards include conducting worker exposure monitoring, notifying workers of their chromium exposures, implementing medical surveillance of workers, providing examining physicians with specific information, implementing a respiratory protection program, notifying laundry personnel of chromium hazards, and maintaining workers' exposure monitoring and medical surveillance records for specific periods.</P>
-                <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Special Issues for Comment</HD>
-                <P>OSHA has a particular interest in comments on the following issues:</P>
-                <P>• Whether the proposed information collection requirements are necessary</P>
-                <P>for the proper performance of the agency's functions to protect workers, including whether the information is useful;</P>
-                <P>• The accuracy of OSHA's estimate of the burden (time and costs) of the information collection requirements, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;</P>
-                <P>• The quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and</P>
-                <P>• Ways to minimize the burden on employers who must comply. For example, by using automated or other technological information collection, and transmission techniques.</P>
-                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Proposed Actions</HD>
-                <P>OSHA is requesting that OMB extend the approval of the information collection requirements contained in the Hexavalent Chromium Standards for General Industry (29 CFR 1910.1026), Shipyard Employment (29 CFR 1915.1026), and Construction (29 CFR 1926.1126). The agency is requesting a 5,715-hour decrease (from 429,318 hours to 423,603 hours) in the number of burden hours approved in the previous package. This reduction is based on the agency's updated rounding methods. The agency is requesting to maintain the previously approved estimate for capital costs, at $43,439,901.</P>
-                <P>OSHA will summarize the comments submitted in response to this notice and will include this summary in the request to OMB to extend the approval of the information collection requirements.</P>

-                <P>Section 203 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act directs the Commission to establish a nine-member Committee of Scientific Advisers on Marine Mammals. The Committee is to consist of scientists knowledgeable in marine ecology and marine mammal affairs. Members are appointed by the Chair of the Commission after consultation with the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Director of the National Science Foundation, and the Chairman of the National Academy of Sciences. The Commission is required to consult with the Committee on all studies and recommendations that it may propose to make or has made, on research programs conducted or proposed to be conducted under the authority of the Act, and on all applications for permits for scientific research.</P>
-                <P>
-                    In selecting individuals to serve on the Committee, the Commission seeks to ensure that the Committee membership as a whole possesses a high level of expertise with respect to scientific disciplines, marine mammal species, and geographic areas of importance to the Commission's responsibilities. In particular, the Commission requires a high level of knowledge with respect to the biology and ecology of certain marine mammal species that, due to their small population levels and/or threats they face, require special attention. In addition, Committee members are selected to provide broad familiarity with marine mammal species and issues from a range of geographic regions where Commission responsibilities are especially great. A listing of the current members of the Committee is available on the Commission's website at

-                <P>With the requested amendment, SNC sought proposed changes to COL, Appendix A, TSs in an application dated January 31, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23031A359), titled, “Exigent License Amendment Request: Technical Specification Exceptions for In-containment Refueling Water Storage Tank Operability Prior to Initial Criticality,” designated as license amendment request (LAR) 23–004. Specifically, the changes add notes (and footnotes) to modify the Modes 5 and 6 operability requirements for the IRWST injection and recirculation flow paths, the IRWST and ADS Stage 4 actuation instrumentation and controls, and the CVS automatic isolation function so that they would not be required to be operable in Modes 5 and 6 prior to initial criticality of the core. Specifically, the licensee proposed revising the Applicability of the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) for the following LCOs:</P>
-                <P>(1) LCO 3.3.8, “Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) Instrumentation,” Table 3.3.8–1:</P>

-                <P>For items one through five previously listed, the Modes 5 and 6 Applicability for each of the instrument channel actuation functions would be modified by a footnote that states, “For Unit 3 only, not required to be OPERABLE prior to initial criticality.” For items six and seven previously listed, the licensee's proposed changes would modify the Applicability for Modes 5 and 6 for the IRWST by adding a note to LCOs 3.5.7 and 3.5.8 that states, “For Unit 3 only, not required to be OPERABLE prior to initial criticality.” Similarly, for LCO 3.3.16 (item eight), the proposed changes would rename the current “NOTE” to be “NOTES,” number the current note to be “1.” and add a note “2.” that states, “For Unit 3 only, ESF Actuation Function for ADS Stage 4 flow paths, In-containment Refueling Water Storage Tank injection and recirculation flow paths, and CVS letdown isolation valves, not required to be OPERABLE prior to initial criticality.”</P>
-                <P>The NRC has issued License Amendment No. 190 to COL NPF–91 for VEGP, Unit 3. The NRC letter to SNC, the safety evaluation, and the amendment document are available in ADAMS under Package Accession No. ML23037A082.</P>

-                <P>
-                    By letter dated January 31, 2023, SNC requested that the NRC amend COL NPF–91 for VEGP, Unit 3. The Commission has issued the amendment, which is described in section I of this 
-                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
-                     notice.
-                </P>
-                <P>
-                    The Commission has determined for this amendment that the application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (the Act), as amended, and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in chapter 1 of title 10 of the 
-                    <E T="03">Code of Federal Regulations</E>
-                     (10 CFR), which are set forth in the license amendment.
-                </P>
-                <P>There were exigent circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, in that the Commission and the licensee had to act quickly, and time did not permit the Commission to publish before issuance its usual notice of consideration of issuance of amendment, proposed no significant hazards consideration (NSHC) determination and opportunity for public comment, and opportunity for a hearing. The Commission did publish a local media notice in The Augusta Chronicle on February 5 and 6, 2023, that provided notice of the licensee's proposed amendment and the proposed NSHC determination and provided a reasonable opportunity for public comment. The Commission was able to consult the State official before issuance. The State of Georgia had no comment.</P>
-                <P>Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that NSHC is involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92, “Issuance of amendment,” and has made a final determination that the amendment involves NSHC. The basis for this determination is contained in the NRC documents listed in section I of this notice. Accordingly, the amendment has been issued and made effective as indicated. Because the amendment was issued in exigent circumstances without prior notice of an opportunity for hearing, the Commission is, with this notice, providing an opportunity for hearing on the amendment. A request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed by May 1, 2023, as discussed later in this notice.</P>
-                <P>The Commission has determined that the amendment satisfies the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment needs to be prepared for this amendment.</P>
-                <P>
-                    For further details with respect to this action, including the Commission's final NSHC determination or discussion of exigent circumstances, see the amendment and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and

-                    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is located in the “Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC” (ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at

-                <P>
-                    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the Office of the Secretary by email at 
-                    <E T="03">Hearing.Docket@nrc.gov,</E>
-                     or by telephone at 301–415–1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.

-                     After a digital ID certificate is obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is available on the NRC's public website at 
-                    <E T="03">https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html.</E>
-                     A filing is considered complete at the time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing system also distributes an email that provides access to the document to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.

Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(b)–(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1).</P>

-                <P>Phlx proposes to make permanent 2 pilots, which are both set to expire on May 4, 2023: (1) the Exchange's pilot to permit the listing and trading of options based on 1/100 the value of the Nasdaq-100 Index (“XND Pilot”), and (2) the Exchange's nonstandard expirations pilot program (“Nonstandard Pilot”).</P>

-                    Phlx filed a rule change to permit the listing and trading of index options on the Nasdaq 100 Micro Index Options (“XND”) on a pilot basis.

-                    <FTREF/>
-                     XND options trade independently of and in addition to NDX options, and the XND options are subject to the same rules that presently govern the trading of index options based on the Nasdaq-100 Index, including sales practice rules, margin requirements, trading rules, and position and exercise limits. Similar to NDX, XND options are European-style and cash-settled, and have a contract multiplier of 100. The contract specifications for XND options mirror in all respects those of the NDX options contract already listed on the Exchange, except that XND options are based on 1/100th of the value of the Nasdaq-100 Index, and are p.m.-settled pursuant to Options 4A, Section 12(a)(5).

-                     The Exchange continues to have sufficient capacity to handle additional quotations and message traffic associated with the listing and trading of XND options. In addition, index options are integrated into the Exchange's existing surveillance system architecture and are thus subject to the relevant surveillance processes. The Exchange also continues to have adequate surveillance procedures to monitor trading in XND options thereby aiding in the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. Additionally, there is continued investor interest in XND.

-                <P>A general timeline of events since 2017 is as follows:</P>
-                <P>• In January 2017, the Exchange discontinued licensing agreements with competing options exchanges for the listing and trading of NDX options. This discontinuation led to a gradual reduction in the number of NDX expiries listed on these exchanges. By 2019 trading in NDX-related options therefore became exclusively done on three Nasdaq-affiliated exchanges: Phlx, Nasdaq ISE, LLC (“ISE”) and Nasdaq GEMX, LLC (“GEMX”).</P>
-                <P>• In January 2018, the expiration of NDX options on Fridays, other than the third Friday-of-the-month, was changed from a.m.-settled to p.m.-settled. Third-Friday expirations continued to be a.m.-settled as before. The p.m.-settled index options were given the new trading symbol “NDXP”. These contracts were exclusively listed on Phlx and ISE.</P>
-                <P>
-                    • In June 2018, a new contract was introduced based on the Nasdaq-100 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13163"/>
-                    Index but with reduced notional value. The underlying index of the new contract, symbol “NQX,” was set at one-fifth the value of the NDX (with contract multiplier remaining at $100). This contract trades exclusively on ISE, and is p.m. settled on Fridays.
-                </P>
-                <P>• In September 2018, a p.m.-settled index option, “NDXP,” was introduced that expired on Wednesdays of each week. It was listed exclusively on Phlx and ISE.</P>
-                <P>• In February 2020, a p.m.-settled NDXP index option was introduced that expired on Mondays of each week. It was listed exclusively on Phlx and ISE.</P>
-                <P>• In April 2021, a second reduced value contract was introduced. The underlying index, “XND”, is set at one-hundredth (1%) of the NDX (with contract multiplier remaining at $100). The notional value is therefore equal to the level of the Nasdaq-100 Index. This contract trades on Phlx and is p.m.-settled.</P>
-                <P>
-                    • On July 29, 2022, ISE received approval to list and trade p.m.-settled NDX index options that expire on Tuesday or Thursday under its Nonstandard Expirations Pilot Program.

In this report, the new p.m.-settled index options will be written as NDXP-Fri, NDXP-Wed, and NDXP-Mon based on their expiration day. The NDX contracts that formerly expired on Fridays, other than the third Friday-of-the-month, will be referred to as NDX-Weekly, indicating their status as weekly contracts. The monthly third Friday NDX contract will be denoted NDX-Monthly. NQX and XND are considered weekly contracts. It may be noted that when Friday is a market holiday, the expiration moves to the prior Thursday.

-                    Historically there have been concerns that p.m.-settled index options could result in increased market and price volatility in the underlying component stocks, due to the unwinding of hedge-related positions at the close on expiration. A study conducted on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis 
-                    <SU>14</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     shows that the market share for p.m.-settled options on S&amp;P 500® Index has grown substantially since 2007. As the expiration date for p.m.-settled index options is more scattered compared to that for a.m.-settled options, only a smaller percentage of open interest expires on each date. As a result, p.m.-settled index option expirations are unlikely to cause any disruptive effect on the market. The DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo also shows that expiring open interest of a.m.-settled options may have had an economically small impact on the volatility of the Nasdaq-100 index around the open.

-                    <FTREF/>
-                     The DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo further shows that, although p.m.-settled index option trading volume may have a statistically significant relationship with the volatility of the underlying index around the market close, the economic significance was generally small. In its report, the Exchange provides additional analysis on market capacity around the market close. As the closing auction price is the most widely used reference price for mutual funds and for many exchange-traded products, closing auction volume has grown substantially in recent years. In this report, the Exchange shows that the closing auction volume on the equity market have become much larger than the opening auction, which may indicate that there is sufficient liquidity in closing auctions to absorb liquidity demand associated with p.m.-settlement of NDX and XND index options.

In conclusion, there is no evidence that NDX and XND options contracts, which are p.m.-settled, would result in reduced trading activity or degradation in market quality of the a.m.-settled index options.</P>

-                <P>The introduction of p.m.-settled index options and its impact on the trading activity of a.m.-settled options is likely the single most important factor under consideration. Volume is the primary indicator of trading interest and it drives market quality to a large extent. Consolidated volume information is available from The Options Price Reporting Authority (“OPRA”), the source of information used in this section. The sample period used for this report is 2017 through April 2022.</P>

-                    As noted above, trading in NDX options began to consolidate exclusively onto Nasdaq-owned affiliated exchanges starting in 2017; the impact on volume was not immediate. Since January 2017, non-Nasdaq exchanges ceased listing new NDX options series, but continued with previously listed NDX options. The following table shows the percentage of NDX options contract volume traded on non-Nasdaq exchanges, which at the

-                <P>A number of observations can be drawn from the graph.</P>
-                <P>• The overall total contract volume remained almost flat until the pandemic market recovery started in the Spring of 2020. From Fall 2020 forward there has been substantial growth in volume. It appears that most of the recent growth has come from the NDX-Weekly contracts.</P>
-                <P>• The volumes of NDX-Monthly and NDX-Weekly were roughly equivalent during 2017. This is noteworthy for the fact that for any given month there would usually be at least three, and sometimes four times, the number of front-month expiries for the weekly contract. The Exchange can infer, then, that the monthly contracts tend to have substantially higher volume per series than the weekly contracts.</P>
-                <P>• When NDX-Weekly transitioned to NDXP-Fri, the volume relationship with NDX-Monthly remained roughly the same.</P>
-                <P>• Soon after launch, the NDXP-Wed contracts achieved volume levels not much lower than the NDXP-Fri contracts, and, in turn, not much lower than the monthly contracts.</P>
-                <P>• Soon after launch, the NDXP-Monday contracts achieved volume levels not much lower than the NDXP-Fri contracts, and, in turn, not much lower than the monthly contracts.</P>
-                <P>• By the end of the sample period, each of the four remaining contract types had roughly the same value (again recognizing the differing number of expiries). Each of the current contract types garner substantial trading volume.</P>
-                <P>Regarding the NDX-Weekly/NDXP-Fri transition, Figure 2, which ends in August 2018, takes a closer look at the timeframe immediately prior to the launch of NDXP-Wed. The transition month of January 2018 is not shown (both contract types had volume during January).</P>

-                </GPH>
-                <P>Though NDXP-Fri volume was relatively low in May 2018, there is no sign of a substantial sustained drop in volume accompanying the transition.</P>
-                <P>During the timeframe under consideration in this report there has been a remarkable increase in the level of the Nasdaq-100 Index, a rough tripling of the index from early 2017 to April 2022. The notional value of a regular-sized contract is $100 times the level of the index, and so it has tripled during the sample period, and is currently roughly $1.3 million. In light of these changes, it is useful to consider volume from the perspective of notional value traded rather than contracts.</P>
-                <P>Figure 3 shows the sum of monthly notional value traded for NDX-Monthly and for the total of all five of the contract types. The notional value traded was computed as the sum of contracts traded times the monthly average value of the Nasdaq-100 Index times $100. The graph also shows linear trend lines for each time series.</P>

-                <P>
-                    It appears that while the notional volume of the incumbent monthly contract has been flat, the total volume of all contract types exhibit a positive trend, with remarkable growth since the Fall of 2020. It appears, therefore, that the introduction of p.m.-settlement is associated with an increase in NDX options trading.

-                <P>The positive volume trend may be due to the remarkable performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index during this timeframe. To rule out this alternative explanation, the exchange compare the volume in NDX/NDXP index options to QQQ ETF options. It is worth noting that the notional volume of a QQQ option contract has been much lower than that of an index option. During the sample period, the average notional value of an index option contract was about $936,000, while a single QQQ contract had notional value of about $23,000.</P>
-                <P>Figure 4 presents a time series of the ratio of the sum of monthly contract volume in the indicated index option contracts to the sum of contract volume in QQQ options. For NDX-Monthly index options, only QQQ volume from third Friday expiring contracts was used. Since both the index and ETF options have the same underlying index, the observed trend is similar if notional volumes were used instead.</P>

-                <P>The graph shows a substantial decline in the relative level of the index option volume during 2017. This decline is too large to be explained by the reduction in the share of options trading on non-Nasdaq exchanges. The decline stabilized at the start of 2018.</P>

-                <P>In spite of the very high notional volume of NDX/NDXP options, volume in the reduced-value NQX options has never been higher than NDXP trading volume (perhaps due to the availability of QQQ options). Figure 5 shows monthly volume for all NQX contracts. Shown are both the volume in terms of contracts traded, as well as NQX volume relative to the total volume of NDX/NDXP contracts. For the latter calculation, the NQX contract volume was divided by 5 to reflect its reduced notional value.</P>

-                <P>Since launch, NQX volume has grown, both in absolute terms and relative to NDX/NDXP volume. The period of extreme market volatility surrounding the pandemic crisis in the Spring of 2020 led to a volume spike, as did the market recovery of the Fall of 2020. Even so, the relative level of NQX volume was very low relative to that of the regular-valued indexes. Due to the low level of NQX volume, it seems unlikely that its introduction had a significant impact on the market quality of the full-sized NDX contracts. Therefore, no further analysis was attempted on NQX options.</P>

-                <P>The open interest in NDX-Monthly is remarkably stable during this timeframe, and is substantially higher than that of the weekly contracts. After transitioning to p.m.-settlement, the open interest in NDXP-Fri contract started to decline while it increased in the second half of 2022. The open interest in the Wednesday and Monday contracts has always been relatively low.</P>
-                <P>Further insight is shown in the following graph, which shows the ratio of open interest in weekly contracts to that of the monthly contract (that is, the open interest sum of NDX-Weekly, NDXP-Fri, -Wed, and Mon divided by the open interest in NDX-Monthly).</P>

-                <P>The graph shows a clear decline in the ratio of weekly to monthly open interest, starting at the beginning of 2018, but the declining trend stabilized at the end of Q1 2018. When considered with the volume information shown above, this may be because options traders with longer holding horizons may be more likely to trade the monthly contract, while those with shorter intra-day positions are more likely to use the weekly contracts. This tendency is reflected in the listing of expiries. At any given time, expirations out to a year or more are available for the monthlies, while expirations only out a month or so are available for the weeklies.</P>
-                <P>As noted above, the notional value of Nasdaq-100 Index options has roughly tripled during this timeframe. It is therefore useful to consider the trends in open interest from a notional perspective, as shown in the following graph.</P>

-                    deterioration of spreads to a.m.-settled Nasdaq-100 Index options by introducing p.m.-settled index options. A particular challenge for measuring quoted spreads is created by the large number of options series tied to a particular underlying. In addition to the range of expiries, a given expiration will have many available strike prices. This set of combinations then is doubled by considering calls and puts. Many listed options series will be very infrequently traded. For example, at the start of the sample period on January 3, 2017, there were 3,720 individual options series that had NDX as the underlying, made up from 14 expiration dates and 382 strike prices. Of these listed options series, only 458 had traded volume on that date, with 233 options series with volume of at least 10 contracts. Nearer to the end of the sample period, on April 29, 2022, there were 16,624 listed options series with NDX or NDXP as the underlying, consisting of 33 expiration dates and 675 strikes. Of the listed options series, 2,192 had some volume and 538 had volume of at least 10 contracts.

-                    To assess the trend in the relative NBBO quoted spread, the Exchange limited the number of options series under consideration by reviewing spreads in the front-month contracts (contract nearest expiration) on the first trading day of each month.

-                         Although the Exchange believes that sampling the first trading day of each month between date January 2017 and April 2022 would reflect the trend of market quality, the Exchange acknowledges that in some cases there may some information loss given a particular trading day. For example, a volatile trading day may not be representative of the market for that trading month.

-                <P>In the following section, the Exchanges shows the impact of the introduction of p.m.- settled index options on the liquidity of NDX contracts by showing the average monthly NDX spread over time (in Figure 10) as well as comparing the trend of relative quoted spread of NDX contracts with that of QQQ contracts (Figures 11 and 12). Figure 10 shows the average monthly relative quoted spread for all options with NDX as the underlying. To better reflect the trend of the relative quoted spread, the Exchange plotted the average relative quoted spread benchmarked against (subtracted by) the average spread of 2017 as the dotted line in Figure 10. The dotted vertical line highlights the time when p.m.-settled index options were introduced. Specifically, the time series in the dotted line was computed using the following steps. First, the Exchange calculated the duration weighted average relative quoted spread for each contract on each day. Second, the Exchange took the average of the above daily spread across all contracts with NDX as the underlying for each day. Third, the Exchange calculated the average relative quoted spread for all months in 2017. Finally, the 2017 average was subtracted from the monthly average to create a time series dataset. As can be seen from the plot, a consistent decrease in the relative quoted spread is prevalent from 2017 to 2022 and most importantly, there is no obvious change in the trend following the introduction of p.m.-settled index options.</P>

-                    Although the above method is intuitive, it is well known that the option premia are correlated with option characteristics such as expiry, strike price, and whether the contract is a put or a call option. Also, option premia tend to increase when the expected volatility of the underlying asset increases, and premia increase may in turn cause the spread to increase.

-                <P>In constructing the plot, the coefficients for those month fixed effects were adjusted. The raw coefficients for each month were collected from the regression output. The first month in the sample, January 2017, implicitly had a coefficient of zero. The average coefficient for the 12 months in 2017 was then calculated. Finally, the average coefficients across all 12 months in 2017 were subtracted from the raw coefficients to create a time series dataset, which is depicted as the unbroken line in Figure 10.</P>
-                <P>
-                    As can be seen from the plot, there is a steady decrease in the relative quoted spread for NDX option contracts. The average relative quoted spread for NDX contracts decreased by about 30%–40% from the beginning of 2017 until the end of the sample period. Since the regression model controls for factors that affect the spread, the unbroken line 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13171"/>
-                    based on the regression model tends to be less volatile. However, there is no large difference in the results between the average spread and results based on the regression models, but there is some divergence at certain points in time. The Exchange conjectures that the divergence is due to higher option premia caused by the elevated levels of volatility. In summary, based on both methods, a consistent decrease in relative quoted spread is observed from 2017 to 2022.

-                     then compared the spread trend of NDX monthly contracts to that of QQQ monthly contracts. The average monthly spread for QQQ contracts was constructed the same way as that for the NDX monthly contracts (as described in detail above). Figure 11, below, displays the patterns of relative quoted spread for NDX and QQQ, which are remarkably similar and decreased during the sample period. Figure 12, below, highlights the difference in Figure 11 as between NDX and QQQ. Relative to a QQQ control, there is therefore no evidence of a deterioration of NDX monthly spreads during the sample period. In summary, the results suggest that there is gradual decrease in both the NDX monthly contracts spread and the QQQ contracts spread during the sample period.

-                <P>As the introduction of p.m.-settled index options may affect the transaction cost for NDX monthly contracts, it is unlikely to affect the spread of QQQ options. Therefore, the Exchange uses the following regression to formally test whether the spread of NDX contract changed after the introduction of p.m.-settled index options. NDX and QQQ options are included in the sample for the period between January 2017 and December 2018. This regression looks at a sample period starting from one year before and ending one year after the introduction of p.m.-settled index options.</P>

-                <P>The report considered one additional question regarding quoted spreads—whether the move from a.m.-settlement to p.m.-settlement for Friday weeklies (NDX-Weekly to NDXP-Fri) led to changes in spreads for those contracts. This sample timeframe was from July 2017 through August 2018, prior to the launch of NDXP-Wed contracts. As before, the Exchange presented both the simple average monthly relative quoted spread as well as the average spread calculated using the regression model.</P>

-                    <PRTPAGE P="13174"/>
-                    from the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo. Among the volatility variables analyzed by the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo was the “Magnitude of Maximum Reversal Overlapping Close” of index futures prices. The DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo found that this metric was higher when the options settlement volume was higher, for both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 Index options. Using data provided in the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo, the Exchange can estimate the impact of a very large increase in settlement volume: an increase from its 25th percentile to its 75th percentile. The following table shows the steps of the calculation.

-                    The percentiles of settlement volume (in units of $10 billion notional) are shown in Table 25 of the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo, which indicated that the volume of S&amp;P 500 contracts was much higher than that of Nasdaq-100 contracts. The regression coefficients are from Table 5 (S&amp;P 500) and Table 19 (Nasdaq-100) of the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo. The estimated impact is the product of the volume difference times the coefficient. Table 5 of the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo provided the median of the volatility metric during the sample period. The relative impact is the estimated impact divided by the sample median,

-                <P>The Exchange provides some additional analysis on market capacity around the market close. Specifically, the Exchange believes it is important to recognize that in recent years the closing auctions on the equity markets have steadily grown to a point where they are much larger than the opening auctions. To illustrate this point, the following chart shows the percentage of dollar volume of Nasdaq-100 Index components executed in the opening and closing auctions on Fridays.</P>

-                    The percentage of volume executed in the close is uniformly higher than that of the open. The spikes in the closing percentages represent third Fridays, and in a few cases Fridays that corresponded to the end of a month. The opening percentage is slightly declining, the closing percentage slightly increasing during this timeframe. As another illustration, consider the opening and closing dollar volume percentages for Fridays, other than the third Friday-of-the-month, from the second half of 2017 compared with the first half of 2018. This timeframe corresponds to the introduction of NDXP options,

-                <P>As would be expected, the relative size of the opening auction declined, and the closing auction increased by roughly the same amount. The percentage of about 0.35% would be an estimate of the volume impact of NDX/NDXP options settlement on the equity market auctions. This percentage is small to begin with, but it is a much smaller proportion of the closing auction than the opening auction. Therefore, the Exchange believes that the liquidity available at or around the close would be able to mitigate any excess volatility created by the options settlement at the market close.</P>

The below table shows the notional settlement volume (in billions of dollars) along with the notional volume in the auctions for Nasdaq-100 Index components. Settlement volume is the average dollar volume settled at OCC, Closing Auction is the average dollar volume executed in the closing auction, Pct of Close is calculated as Settlement Volume divided by Closing Auction, Open Auction is the average notional volume executed in the open auction, and Pct of Open is calculated as Settlement Volume divided by Opening Auction.

-                <P>Table 6 shows that the settlement volume for NDXP settlements averages between 26% and 45% of the closing auction volume, the Friday NDXP settlements being the largest. NDX settlement volumes are larger, and relative to the opening auction—the relevant auction—they average more than twice the size of the auctions. By contrast, the relative size of the settlement volume would be about a third less if it were compared to the closing auctions on the third Fridays. As documented in the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo, p.m.-settled option activities only have a very small impact on the volatility of the underlying index. Additionally, the size of the option settlement value is relatively small compared with the size of the closing auction value. Therefore, the Exchange believes that it is difficult to manipulate the underlying Nasdaq-100 Index during the closing auction. The equity closing auctions have grown to be substantial liquidity events (for the period examined the closing auction volume is larger than the opening auction volume) and would therefore be suited for handling the excess liquidity demand created by index options settlement.</P>

-                    Similar to Cboe, Phlx has provided pilot data to the Commission with respect to its XND Pilot and Nonstandard Pilot. The Exchange's analysis presents data that the introduction of p.m.-settlement has led to an increase in options trading tied to the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Exchange notes within its analysis that it seems unlikely that the introduction of XND

-                     had a significant impact on the market quality of the full-sized Nasdaq-100 Index option contracts. The Exchange observed a consistent decrease in relative quoted spread is observed from 2017 to 2022 for NDX options. When the Exchange compared the spread trend of NDX monthly contracts to that of QQQ monthly contracts, the results suggest that there is gradual decrease in both the NDX monthly contracts spread and the QQQ contracts spread during the sample period.

-                <P>The Exchange also considered whether the move from a.m.-settlement to p.m.-settlement for Friday weeklies (NDX-Weekly to NDXP-Fri) led to changes in spreads for those contracts. Overall, the Exchange sees no evidence of deterioration of spreads associated with the changes the Exchange has made to its Nasdaq-100 Index product offering by introducing p.m.-settled products.</P>
-                <P>Finally, in considering impact on the closing process in equity markets, the Exchange concluded that it is difficult to manipulate the underlying Nasdaq-100 Index. Specifically, the equity closing auctions have grown to be substantial liquidity events that are much larger than the opening auctions, and would therefore be better suited for handling the excess liquidity demand created by index options settlement. The Exchange believes the expiration of p.m.-settlement options would not adversely affect the options market or the underlying cash equities market.</P>
-                <P>Further, the Exchange has sufficient systems capacity to handle p.m.-settled options on broad-based indexes with nonstandard expirations dates and has not encountered any issues or adverse market effects as a result of listing them.</P>
-                <P>Accordingly, the Exchange believes that weekly expirations and EOMs, including the XND expirations, in the p.m.-settled products should create greater trading and hedging opportunities and flexibility and provide customers with the ability to more closely tailor their investment objectives.</P>

-                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Making permanent the XND Pilot and the Nonstandard Pilot will not impose an undue burden on competition, rather, it will continue to provide investors with greater trading and hedging opportunities and flexibility, as well as the ability to more closely tailor their investment objectives.</P>
-                <P>Additionally, the Exchange does not believe the proposal will impose any burden on intermarket competition as market participants are welcome to become members or member organizations and trade at Phlx if they determine that this proposed rule change has made Phlx more attractive or favorable. Finally, all options exchanges are free to compete by listing and trading their own broad-based index options with weekly or end of month expirations.</P>

-                <P>Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the “Exchange” or “BZX”) proposes to amend Rule 11.9(e)(3) to provide that orders may be modified from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using a Replace Message. The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 11.12(a)(4) to provide that a change in position from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) will result in a loss of time priority if made when a short sale circuit breaker pursuant to Rule 201 of Regulation SHO is in effect. Additionally, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 11.13(b)(1) to provide when the Exchange may route orders with a short sale instruction when a short sale circuit breaker pursuant to Rule 201 of Regulation SHO is in effect.

-                    The Exchange first proposes to amend Rule 11.9(e)(3) to provide that an order's position may be modified from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) through the use of a Replace Message. The Exchange notes that Users complete a position modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using the same functionality to mark an order as either sell long or sell short under Rule 11.9(e)(3). The Exchange believes this change will provide additional specificity to the rule and ensure the rule uses terminology consistent with the description of Replace Messages and their impact on an order's priority under Exchange Rule 11.12(a)(4) (discussed 
-                    <E T="03">infra</E>

-                    The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 11.12(a)(4) in order to align the Rule text with how the System currently behaves when an SSCB is in effect, and to provide clarification to Users that when an SSCB is in effect that changing an order's position from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) will instead result in such order receiving a new timestamp and losing its original priority. The Exchange is not proposing to change the timestamp for modifications from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) when an SSCB is 
-                    <E T="03">not</E>
-                     in effect. Additionally, the Exchange is also proposing to add language to Rule 11.12(a)(4) stating that a modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) is a type of order modification that would retain time priority and would not receive a new timestamp, regardless of whether an SSCB is in effect (discussed 
-                    <E T="03">infra</E>

-                    by a Replace Message rather than cancelled and replaced with a new order. This change is intended to provide that an order does not need to be cancelled and replaced with a new order, but rather includes modifications to orders via the use of a Replace Message. The proposed changes to Exchange Rule 11.12(a)(4) are based on previously-approved changes to MIAX Pearl Rule 2616(a)(5), which is substantially similar to Exchange Rule 11.12(a)(4).

-                    In the event that a User requests an order modification using a Replace Message, the System will first determine whether the modification is of a kind that may result in a loss of time priority in order to determine how the modification will be handled by the System. For example, as noted in Exchange Rule 11.12(a)(4), a modification to the price of an order will cause the loss of time priority. Therefore, in the event of a modification of the price of an order, the System will first determine that the type of modification may result in a loss of time priority and then handle the order accordingly by giving it a new timestamp.

-                    <FTREF/>
-                     Since an order modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may result in a change in price of the order when an SSCB is in effect, the Exchange immediately gives the order a new timestamp. As previously discussed, a modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or a modification from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) requires the System to determine whether an order must be re-priced to be compliant with the requirements of Regulation SHO. The Exchange notes, however, that an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) does not require the System to determine whether the order shall be re-priced as a result of the modification, as both a sell long and a sell short exempt order may execute at a more aggressive price than a sell short order when an SSCB is in effect. Given that the System does not have to evaluate whether a price change is required as part of an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa), this specific order modification does not lose priority on the BZX Book.

-                         Alternatively, as noted in Rule 11.12(a)(4) a modification that involves a decrease in the size of the order will not cause the loss of time priority. Therefore, in order to decrease the size of the order, the System will first determine that the type of modification will not result in a loss of time priority and will handle the order in a completely different manner than it would if the order would have resulted in a loss of time priority.

-                    Specifically, if a sell long order is modified to a sell short order (or vice versa) or a sell short exempt order is modified to a sell short order (or vice versa) while an SSCB is in effect, the Exchange cannot simply change the order from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) while resting on the book, but rather must verify that the sell short order would not violate Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) 
-                    <SU>14</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     of Regulation SHO before the order is re-added to the BZX Book. Therefore, as such a modification may result in a change of the order's price, the System gives the order a new timestamp, resulting in a loss of priority. Similarly, if a sell short order is modified to a sell long order (or vice versa) or a sell short order is modified to a sell short exempt (or vice versa) order while an SSCB is in effect, the order may be eligible to display at a more aggressive price. As such, the System gives the order a new timestamp, again resulting in a loss of time priority, but potentially in improved price priority. However, if an order is modified from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) when an SSCB is in effect, the System does not have to take an additional step to evaluate whether the modification violates Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO given that sell long and sell short exempt orders may execute at more aggressive prices that sell short orders during an SSCB. Accordingly, an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) would not result in a loss of priority. Stated differently, the System treats orders marked sell long and sell short exempt the same, and only order modifications from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) would cause an order to lose priority during an SSCB because the System is required to determine whether a change in the order's price is required as a consequence of the change in status from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa). This order price analysis by the System is required in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO as orders may be required to be re-priced to prevent potential violations of Rule 201 when the SSCB is in effect.

-                         Pursuant to Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, the Exchange must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security at a price that is less than or equal to the current NBB during an SSCB.

-                <P>To illustrate order behavior with a modification from sell long to sell short during an SSCB, consider the following example:</P>
-                <P>
-                    Assume the National Best Bid and Offer (“NBBO”) 
-                    <SU>15</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     in a given covered security 
-                    <SU>16</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     is $5.00 × $5.10 while an SSCB is in effect. A User enters a non-displayed sell long order with a limit price of $5.00. Subsequently, the User modifies the position of the order from sell long to sell short, while the NBBO has remained the same. In order to effect the modification, the System determines that a modification from sell long to sell short may result in a change in the order's price in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, as orders may be required to be repriced to prevent potential violations of Rule 201 when the SSCB is in effect. Accordingly, the order loses its time priority in order for the System to handle the potential price change. In this example, the subject order resulted in a change of the order's price as the sell short order was not eligible for execution at a price equal to the NBB. Nonetheless, even if the modification would not have ultimately resulted in a price change, the modification would have necessarily caused the System to evaluate whether a price change was necessary and, thus, required a new timestamp, resulting in a loss of time priority.

-                <P>
-                    Additionally, the proposed rule change to Rule 11.12(a)(4) is designed to ensure all sell short orders are subjected to the Exchange's process for ensuring that the order would not violate Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO during an SSCB. In order to verify the displayed price of an order with a position modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB, the System handles the modification as if a price change would occur, even if the modification does not ultimately result in a price change. If the System permitted such order modifications to forego this process, no order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB would result in a loss of time priority, and as a result, certain sell short orders could be permitted to display or execute at an impermissible price that would not comply with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii). The Exchange's process is designed to ensure compliance with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO and is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. As designed, during an SSCB, the System determines up front whether an order modification could result in a price change before it can properly effect the modification. If the modification is of a type that may result in a price change to comply with Regulation SHO, the 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13180"/>
-                    System gives the order a new timestamp. As a result, such a modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) always results in a loss of time priority even if the modification did not result in a change of the order's price. Conversely, an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) does not result in an order losing priority because the System does not conduct an order price analysis to ensure compliance with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO as both sell long and sell short exempt orders may execute at more aggressive prices than sell short orders during an SSCB.
-                </P>
-                <P>
-                    Moreover, the Exchange processes billions of order modifications each month, with only a limited amount of modifications involving a change from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB. Out of the billions of order modifications processed by the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges during the months of May, June, and July 2022, the Exchange identified approximately 369,884 order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) across the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges during an SSCB that would potentially be affected by the proposed amendment to Rule 11.12(a)(4).
-                    <SU>29</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     Given that 369,884 order modifications during an SSCB across the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges is an extremely small percentage of the billions of order modifications that the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges processed during the months of May, June, and July 2022, the Exchange believes that any benefit from restoring priority to this limited amount of order modifications is outweighed by the burden of changing the System to be able to conduct an order price analysis in real time to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO and to permit these orders to retain priority.

If marked “short exempt,” the Exchange shall execute, display and/or route an order without regard to any short sale price test restriction in effect under Regulation SHO. The Exchange relies on the marking of an order as “short exempt” when handling such order, and thus, it is the entering Member's responsibility, not the Exchange's responsibility, to comply with the requirements of Regulation SHO relating to marking of orders as “short exempt.”.”

-                <P>The proposed amendment to Rule 11.9(e)(3) is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because it does not seek to change how order modifications from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) are accomplished. Instead, the proposed change provides clarity to Users that a position change from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may be accomplished through the use of a Replace Message and does not require an order to be cancelled and a new order submitted in order to modify an order's position to sell short exempt. The proposed change to Rule 11.9(e)(3) will also provide continuity between Rule 11.9(e)(3) and the proposed changes to Rule 11.12(a)(4), and as such are directly intended to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and national market system.</P>
-                <P>The proposed change to Rule 11.12(a)(4) removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because it addresses a limited scenario when a User modifies an order's position using a Replace Message during an SSCB. The proposed rule change specifically states that orders whose positions are modified from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using a Replace Message when an SSCB is not in effect will not receive a new timestamp and will not lose priority as compared to other orders on the BZX Book. Further, the proposed rule change provides that order modifications from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) using a Replace Message will not lose priority as compared to other orders on the BZX Book, regardless of whether an SSCB is in effect. Additionally, the proposed change to Rule 11.12(a)(4) removes impediments to and perfects a free and open market system because it is designed to make clear to Users that orders may be modified using a Replace Message without losing priority subject to the limitations named in Rule 11.12(a)(4). This change does not amend the meaning or operation of Rule 11.12(a)(4).</P>
-                <P>The proposed changes to Rule 11.13(b)(1) are designed to provide that any sell short order that will post to an away Trading Center will be routed when an SSCB is in effect. In addition, providing Users the ability to send sell short orders that will post to an away Trading Center, and thus are routable when an SSCB is in effect provides them additional flexibility with regard to the handling of their orders, and may provide additional execution opportunities for those orders. Given this, the proposed amendments to Rule 11.13(b)(1) are directly targeted at removing impediments to and perfecting the mechanism of a free and open market and national market system, as well as to assure fair competition among brokers and dealers and among exchange markets.</P>
-                <P>
-                    The proposed change to Rule 11.13(b)(1) further promotes just and equitable principles of trade and perfects a free and open market system by identifying which orders containing routing instructions are eligible to route and post to an away market center during an SSCB. As all Trading Centers are required to comply with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, a User can expect that an order routed from the Exchange to an away market center will 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13181"/>
-                    be treated similarly on the away market center as it would on the Exchange during an SSCB. There is no change to the meaning or operation of this rule, but rather an amendment to make clear that an order that is eligible to post to an away market may be routed during an SSCB.
-                </P>
-                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
-                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act as the proposed rule changes are not being proposed for competitive reasons. Rather, the proposed amendment to Rule 11.9(e)(3) provides that modifications from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may be accomplished through the use of a Replace Message. This proposed amendment will not change existing System behavior and Users will have more certainty about how orders may be modified, which is related to the proposed changes to Rule 11.12(a)(4). Order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) use the same Replace Message functionality as a modification from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa), and amending Rule 11.9(e)(3) to describe this behavior for Users is directly related to the Exchange's proposed changes to Rule 11.12(a)(4) and does not impose a burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act.</P>
-                <P>Additionally, the proposed amendments to Rule 11.12(a)(4) will enhance the transparency of the rules by revising the rule text. By revising the rule text to align with the current System behavior, Users will be aware that if they modify their orders from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) and an SSCB is in effect, their orders will be given a new timestamp and lose time priority. Users are free to consider this proposed change as part of their overall experience with the Exchange, which also includes execution quality and functionality offerings, when making order routing decisions. Additionally, the Exchange notes that the proposed rule change applies equally to all Users, and all Users' orders are subject to the described functionality, regardless of their size. Users may not opt-out of this System functionality.</P>
-                <P>Furthermore, this loss of time priority for a position modification would only occur when an SSCB is in effect and the Exchange is required to comply with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO. The impact of an order modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using a Replace Message during an SSCB with respect to loss of time priority is no different than when a User seeks to increase the size of their order using a Replace Message or when a User seeks to change the position of their order by cancelling the existing order and entering a new order. In each instance, the order will receive a new timestamp reflecting the time the modification was made and the order would lose priority as compared to other orders on the BZX Book.</P>
-                <P>
-                    Furthermore, the proposed change to Rule 11.12(a)(4) does not impose any burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act in that the proposed change does not present a novel approach to sell short order handling. Indeed, the proposed changes to Rule 11.12(a)(4) are consistent with a recently approved amendment

-                     Pursuant to MIAX Pearl Rule 2616(a), any position modification involving a change from sell long to either sell short exempt or sell short (or vice versa) will result in the order receiving a new timestamp and the order losing priority, as compared to other orders resting on the book while an SSCB is in effect. The Exchange's proposed Rule is also similar to MIAX Pearl Rule 2616(a) in that modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) and modifications from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) will be subject to a loss of priority during an SSCB.

-                </FTNT>
-                <P>While the proposed rule change is substantially similar to that of MIAX Pearl, the Exchange's proposal differs in that its proposal would not cause orders modified from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) to lose priority during an SSCB, whereas MIAX Pearl Rule 2616(a) specifically states that a change from sell long to sell short exempt is a type of order modification that would be subject to a loss of priority during an SSCB. The Exchange's System does not view an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) as a type of change which requires an order price analysis in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, and as such does not cause these types of order modifications to result in a loss of priority.</P>
-                <P>
-                    In addition, the proposed rule change is more narrowly tailored than the rules of Investors Exchange LLC (“IEX”), which requires market participants to enter a new order where an order's position is changed even when an SSCB is not in effect

-                    <FTREF/>
-                     and Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”), which requires orders to be cancelled if the order's position is redesignated as short during a Short Sale Period and the order is not priced at a Permitted Price or higher under Nasdaq Rule 4763(e).
-                    <SU>36</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     In each instance mentioned above, the original order would need to be replaced with a new order and therefore would receive a new timestamp which would result in a loss of priority. The Exchange is seeking to only append a new timestamp and cause a loss of priority as compared to other orders on the BZX Book when an order's position is modified from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB, which is more narrowly-tailored than the rules governing similar order behavior on MIAX Pearl, IEX and Nasdaq.

-                    Furthermore, the proposed change to Rule 11.13(b)(1) does not impose any burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act as it makes clear that orders that may post to away market centers will be routed during an SSCB. Users will have the ability to take this factor into consideration when determining which routing strategy to use when entering an order on the Exchange and are able to consider this proposed change as part of their overall experience with the Exchange. If a User disfavors this proposed change they are free to use a different routing strategy or submit an order directly to an away market center. This proposed change is not being proposed for competitive reasons, but rather to make clear that any order eligible to be posted to an away market center will be routed during an SSCB. As each market center is required to comply with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO, the Exchange believes that any order eligible to be posted to an

-                    away market center should be permitted to route, as the order would be subject to the away market center's rules regarding compliance with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO upon posting.

The Exchange has asked the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay. The Exchange states the proposed rule change provides clarity on how orders modified to sell short exempt are accomplished and the priority of orders marked sell short exempt. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change related to modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) that occur during an SSCB will affect only a small percentage of overall order modifications.

The Commission believes that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because the proposed rule change does not raise any new or novel issues.

-                     NQX options trade independently of and in addition to NDX options, and the NQX options are subject to the same rules that presently govern the trading of index options based on the Nasdaq-100, including sales practice rules, margin requirements, trading rules, and position and exercise limits. Similar to NDX, NQX options are European-style and cash-settled, and have a contract multiplier of 100. The contract specifications for NQX options mirror in all respects those of the NDX options contract listed on the Exchange, except that NQX options are based on

In addition, index options are integrated into the Exchange's existing surveillance system architecture and are thus subject to the relevant surveillance processes. The Exchange also continues to have adequate surveillance procedures to monitor trading in NQX options thereby aiding in the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. Additionally, there is continued investor interest in NQX.

Weekly Expirations are subject to all provisions of Options 4A, Section 12 and are treated the same as options on the same underlying index that expire on the third Friday of the expiration month.

-                     Specifically, the Exchange analyzed trading volume, open interest, spreads, and closing auction volumes. In recent years, ISE has implemented changes and introduced new types of index options tied to the Nasdaq-100 Index® (ticker symbol “NDX”). This report presents a set of empirical findings relating the impact of these changes, submitted in support of a request for permanency of the NQX Pilot and the Nonstandard Pilot.

-                <P>A general timeline of events since 2017 is as follows:</P>
-                <P>• In January 2017, the Exchange discontinued licensing agreements with competing options exchanges for the listing and trading of NDX options. This discontinuation led to a gradual reduction in the number of NDX expiries listed on these exchanges. By 2019 trading in NDX-related options therefore became exclusively done on three Nasdaq-affiliated exchanges: Nasdaq Phlx, LLC (“Phlx”), ISE, and Nasdaq GEMX, LLC (“GEMX”).</P>
-                <P>• In January 2018, the expiration of NDX options on Fridays, other than the third Friday-of-the-month, was changed from a.m.-settled to p.m.-settled. Third-Friday expirations continued to be a.m.-settled as before. The p.m.-settled index options were given the new trading symbol “NDXP”. These contracts were exclusively listed on Phlx and ISE.</P>
-                <P>• In June 2018, a new contract was introduced based on the Nasdaq-100 Index but with reduced notional value. The underlying index of the new contract, symbol “NQX,” was set at one-fifth the value of the NDX (with contract multiplier remaining at $100). This contract trades exclusively on ISE, and is p.m. settled on Fridays.</P>
-                <P>• In September 2018, a p.m.-settled index option, “NDXP,” was introduced that expired on Wednesdays of each week. It was listed exclusively on Phlx and ISE.</P>
-                <P>• In February 2020, a p.m.-settled NDXP index option was introduced that expired on Mondays of each week. It was listed exclusively on Phlx and ISE.</P>
-                <P>• In April 2021, a second reduced value contract was introduced. The underlying index, “XND”, is set at one-hundredth (1%) of the NDX (with contract multiplier remaining at $100). The notional value is therefore equal to the level of the Nasdaq-100 Index. This contract trades on Phlx and is p.m.-settled.</P>
-                <P>
-                    • On July 29, 2022, ISE received approval to list and trade p.m.-settled NDX index options that expire on Tuesday or Thursday under its Nonstandard Expirations Pilot Program.

-                    Following terminological convention, the Exchange refers to the traditional third Friday expiration series as “monthly” contracts, while the other series are referred to as “weekly” contracts. In this report, the new p.m.-settled index options will be written as NDXP-Fri, NDXP-Wed, and NDXP-Mon based on their expiration day. The NDX contracts that formerly expired on Fridays, other than the third Friday-of-the-month, will be referred to as NDX-Weekly, indicating their status as weekly contracts. The monthly third Friday NDX contract will be denoted NDX-Monthly. NQX and XND are considered weekly contracts. It may be noted that when Friday is a market holiday, the expiration moves to the prior Thursday.

-                    The purpose of this report is to empirically assess the impact of these changes on NDX options markets, with a special focus on the market quality of the incumbent a.m.-settled NDX index options and market capacity around the market close. The Exchange provides a comprehensive analysis in this report on the impact of p.m.-settled index options on a.m.-settled NDX index options, including option trading volume, option open interests and option liquidity.

While activity in QQQ options would capture trading interest in the Nasdaq-100 Index generally and may reflect market conditions, it would be largely unaffected by the innovations considered in this report. QQQ options include monthly third Friday expirations, weekly non-third Friday expirations, and contracts expiring the end of the quarter.

-                    Historically there have been concerns that p.m.-settled index options could result in increased market and price volatility in the underlying component stocks, due to the unwinding of hedge-related positions at the close on expiration. A study conducted on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis 
-                    <SU>14</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     shows that the market share for p.m.-settled options on S&amp;P 500® Index has grown substantially since 2007. As the expiration date for p.m.-settled index options is more scattered compared to that for a.m.-settled options, only a smaller percentage of open interest expires on each date. As a result, p.m.-settled index option expirations are unlikely to cause any disruptive effect on the market. The DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo also shows that expiring open interest of a.m.-settled options may have had an economically small impact on the volatility of the Nasdaq-100 index around the open.

-                     The DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo further shows that, although p.m.-settled index option trading volume may have a statistically significant relationship with the volatility of the underlying index around the market close, the economic significance was generally small. In its report, the Exchange provides additional analysis on market capacity around the market close. As the closing auction price is the most widely used reference price for mutual funds and for many exchange-traded products, closing auction volume has grown substantially in recent years. In this report, the Exchange shows that the closing auction volume on the equity market have become much larger than the opening auction, which may indicate that there is sufficient liquidity in closing auctions to absorb liquidity demand associated with p.m.-settlement of NDX and NQX index options.

-                    In addition to analysis on closing auctions, the report presents findings on three market characteristics: trading volume, open interest, and spreads. The Exchange finds that the trading volume and the notional open interests for options that had NDX and NQX as the underlying increased during our sample period. In conclusion, there is no evidence that NDX and NQX options contracts, which are p.m.-settled, would result in reduced trading activity or degradation in market quality of the a.m.-settled index options.

Since January 2017, non-Nasdaq exchanges ceased listing new NDX options series, but continued with previously listed NDX options. The following table shows the percentage of NDX options contract volume traded on non-Nasdaq exchanges, which at the time included Cboe Exchange, Inc. (“Cboe”), NYSE American LLC, and NYSE Arca, Inc. Of these three markets, Cboe was the largest in volume. The Nasdaq affiliated exchanges trading NDX options were Phlx, ISE and GEMX.

-                <P>• The overall total contract volume remained almost flat until the pandemic market recovery started in the Spring of 2020. From Fall 2020 forward there has been substantial growth in volume. It appears that most of the recent growth has come from the NDX-Weekly contracts.</P>
-                <P>
-                    • The volumes of NDX-Monthly and NDX-Weekly were roughly equivalent during 2017. This is noteworthy for the fact that for any given month there would usually be at least three, and

-                    sometimes four times, the number of front-month expiries for the weekly contract. The Exchange can infer, then, that the monthly contracts tend to have substantially higher volume per series than the weekly contracts.
-                </P>
-                <P>• When NDX-Weekly transitioned to NDXP-Fri, the volume relationship with NDX-Monthly remained roughly the same.</P>
-                <P>• Soon after launch, the NDXP-Wed contracts achieved volume levels not much lower than the NDXP-Fri contracts, and, in turn, not much lower than the monthly contracts.</P>
-                <P>• Soon after launch, the NDXP-Monday contracts achieved volume levels not much lower than the NDXP-Fri contracts, and, in turn, not much lower than the monthly contracts.</P>
-                <P>• By the end of the sample period, each of the four remaining contract types had roughly the same value (again recognizing the differing number of expiries). </P>
-                <P>Each of the current contract types garner substantial trading volume.</P>
-                <P>Regarding the NDX-Weekly/NDXP-Fri transition, Figure 2, which ends in August 2018, takes a closer look at the timeframe immediately prior to the launch of NDXP-Wed. The transition month of January 2018 is not shown (both contract types had volume during January).</P>

-                <P>During the timeframe under consideration in this report there has been a remarkable increase in the level of the Nasdaq-100 Index, a rough tripling of the index from early 2017 to April 2022. The notional value of a regular-sized contract is $100 times the level of the index, and so it has tripled during the sample period, and is currently roughly $1.3 million. In light of these changes, it is useful to consider volume from the perspective of notional value traded rather than contracts.</P>
-                <P>Figure 3 shows the sum of monthly notional value traded for NDX-Monthly and for the total of all five of the contract types. The notional value traded was computed as the sum of contracts traded times the monthly average value of the Nasdaq-100 Index times $100.

-                <P>It appears that while the notional volume of the incumbent monthly contract has been flat, the total volume of all contract types exhibit a positive trend, with remarkable growth since the Fall of 2020. It appears, therefore, that the introduction of p.m.-settlement is associated with an increase in NDX options trading.</P>
-                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Comparison With QQQ Volume</HD>
-                <P>The positive volume trend may be due to the remarkable performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index during this timeframe. To rule out this alternative explanation, the exchange compare the volume in NDX/NDXP index options to QQQ ETF options. It is worth noting that the notional volume of a QQQ option contract has been much lower than that of an index option. During the sample period, the average notional value of an index option contract was about $936,000, while a single QQQ contract had notional value of about $23,000.</P>
-                <P>Figure 4 presents a time series of the ratio of the sum of monthly contract volume in the indicated index option contracts to the sum of contract volume in QQQ options. For NDX-Monthly index options, only QQQ volume from third Friday expiring contracts was used. Since both the index and ETF options have the same underlying index, the observed trend is similar if notional volumes were used instead.</P>

-                <P>In spite of the very high notional volume of NDX/NDXP options, volume in the reduced-value NQX options has never been higher than NDXP trading volume (perhaps due to the availability of QQQ options). Figure 5 shows monthly volume for all NQX contracts. Shown are both the volume in terms of contracts traded, as well as NQX volume relative to the total volume of NDX/NDXP contracts. For the latter calculation, the NQX contract volume was divided by 5 to reflect its reduced notional value.</P>

-                <P>Since launch, NQX volume has grown, both in absolute terms and relative to NDX/NDXP volume. The period of extreme market volatility surrounding the pandemic crisis in the Spring of 2020 led to a volume spike, as did the market recovery of the Fall of 2020. Even so, the relative level of NQX volume was very low relative to that of the regular-valued indexes. Due to the low level of NQX volume, it seems unlikely that its introduction had a significant impact on the market quality of the full-sized NDX contracts. Therefore, no further analysis was attempted on NQX options.</P>

When considered with the volume information shown above, this may be because options traders with longer holding horizons may be more likely to trade the monthly contract, while those with shorter intra-day positions are more likely to use the weekly contracts. This tendency is reflected in the listing of expiries.

-                    Nasdaq-100 Index options by introducing p.m.-settled index options. A particular challenge for measuring quoted spreads is created by the large number of options series tied to a particular underlying. In addition to the range of expiries, a given expiration will have many available strike prices. This set of combinations then is doubled by considering calls and puts. Many listed options series will be very infrequently traded. For example, at the start of the sample period on January 3, 2017, there were 3,720 individual options series that had NDX as the underlying, made up from 14 expiration dates and 382 strike prices. Of these listed options series, only 458 had traded volume on that date, with 233 options series with volume of at least 10 contracts. Nearer to the end of the sample period, on April 29, 2022, there were 16,624 listed options series with NDX or NDXP as the underlying, consisting of 33 expiration dates and 675 strikes. Of the listed options series, 2,192 had some volume and 538 had volume of at least 10 contracts.

For example, a volatile trading day may not be representative of the market for that trading month.

-                <P>In the following section, the Exchanges shows the impact of the introduction of p.m.-settled index options on the liquidity of NDX contracts by showing the average monthly NDX spread over time (in Figure 10) as well as comparing the trend of relative quoted spread of NDX contracts with that of QQQ contracts (Figures 11 and 12). Figure 10 shows the average monthly relative quoted spread for all options with NDX as the underlying. To better reflect the trend of the relative quoted spread, the Exchange plotted the average relative quoted spread benchmarked against (subtracted by) the average spread of 2017 as the dotted line in Figure 10. The dotted vertical line highlights the time when p.m.-settled index options were introduced. Specifically, the time series in the dotted line was computed using the following steps. First, the Exchange calculated the duration weighted average relative quoted spread for each contract on each day. Second, the Exchange took the average of the above daily spread across all contracts with NDX as the underlying for each day. Third, the Exchange calculated the average relative quoted spread for all months in 2017. Finally, the 2017 average was subtracted from the monthly average to create a time series dataset. As can be seen from the plot, a consistent decrease in the relative quoted spread is prevalent from 2017 to 2022 and most importantly, there is no obvious change in the trend following the introduction of p.m.-settled index options.</P>

-                    Although the above method is intuitive, it is well known that the option premia are correlated with option characteristics such as expiry, strike price, and whether the contract is a put or a call option. Also, option premia tend to increase when the expected volatility of the underlying asset increases, and premia increase may in turn cause the spread to increase.

-                <P>In constructing the plot, the coefficients for those month fixed effects were adjusted. The raw coefficients for each month were collected from the regression output. The first month in the sample, January 2017, implicitly had a coefficient of zero. The average coefficient for the 12 months in 2017 was then calculated. Finally, the average coefficients across all 12 months in 2017 were subtracted from the raw coefficients to create a time series dataset, which is depicted as the unbroken line in Figure 10.</P>
-                <P>
-                    As can be seen from the plot, there is a steady decrease in the relative quoted spread for NDX option contracts. The average relative quoted spread for NDX contracts decreased by about 30%–40% from the beginning of 2017 until the end of the sample period. Since the regression model controls for factors that affect the spread, the unbroken line 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13192"/>
-                    based on the regression model tends to be less volatile. However, there is no large difference in the results between the average spread and results based on the regression models, but there is some divergence at certain points in time. The Exchange conjectures that the divergence is due to higher option premia caused by the elevated levels of volatility. In summary, based on both methods, a consistent decrease in relative quoted spread is observed from 2017 to 2022.

The average monthly spread for QQQ contracts was constructed the same way as that for the NDX monthly contracts (as described in detail above). Figure 11, below, displays the patterns of relative quoted spread for NDX and QQQ, which are remarkably similar and decreased during the sample period. Figure 12, below, highlights the difference in Figure 11 as between NDX and QQQ. Relative to a QQQ control, there is therefore no evidence of a deterioration of NDX monthly spreads during the sample period. In summary, the results suggest that there is gradual decrease in both the NDX monthly contracts spread and the QQQ contracts spread during the sample period.

-                <P>As the introduction of p.m.-settled index options may affect the transaction cost for NDX monthly contracts, it is unlikely to affect the spread of QQQ options. Therefore, the Exchange uses the following regression to formally test whether the spread of NDX contract changed after the introduction of p.m.-settled index options. NDX and QQQ options are included in the sample for the period between January 2017 and December 2018. This regression looks at a sample period starting from one year before and ending one year after the introduction of p.m.-settled index options.</P>

-                <P>The following provides an illustration using some of the regression results from the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo. Among the volatility variables analyzed by the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo was the “Magnitude of Maximum Reversal Overlapping Close” of index futures prices. The DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo found that this metric was higher when the options settlement volume was higher, for both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 Index options. Using data provided in the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo, the Exchange can estimate the impact of a very large increase in settlement volume: an increase from its 25th percentile to its 75th percentile. The following table shows the steps of the calculation.</P>

-                <P>The Exchange provides some additional analysis on market capacity around the market close. Specifically, the Exchange believes it is important to recognize that in recent years the closing auctions on the equity markets have steadily grown to a point where they are much larger than the opening auctions. To illustrate this point, the following chart shows the percentage of dollar volume of Nasdaq-100 Index components executed in the opening and closing auctions on Fridays.</P>

-                    The percentage of volume executed in the close is uniformly higher than that of the open. The spikes in the closing percentages represent third Fridays, and in a few cases Fridays that corresponded to the end of a month. The opening percentage is slightly declining, the closing percentage slightly increasing during this timeframe. As another illustration, consider the opening and closing dollar volume percentages for Fridays, other than the third Friday-of-the-month, from the second half of 2017 compared with the first half of 2018. This timeframe corresponds to the introduction of NDXP options,

-                <P>As would be expected, the relative size of the opening auction declined, and the closing auction increased by roughly the same amount. The percentage of about 0.35% would be an estimate of the volume impact of NDX/NDXP options settlement on the equity market auctions. This percentage is small to begin with, but it is a much smaller proportion of the closing auction than the opening auction. Therefore, the Exchange believes that the liquidity available at or around the close would be able to mitigate any excess volatility created by the options settlement at the market close.</P>

-                     To provide the most up-to-date view of the current situation, the Exchange examined activity from the start of 2021 through April 2022. The below table shows the notional settlement volume (in billions of dollars) along with the notional volume in the auctions for Nasdaq-100 Index components. Settlement volume is the average dollar volume settled at OCC, Closing Auction is the average dollar volume executed in the closing auction, Pct of Close is calculated as Settlement Volume divided by Closing Auction, Open Auction is the average notional volume executed in the open auction, and Pct of Open is calculated as Settlement Volume divided by Opening Auction.

-                <P>Table 6 shows that the settlement volume for NDXP settlements averages between 26% and 45% of the closing auction volume, the Friday NDXP settlements being the largest. NDX settlement volumes are larger, and relative to the opening auction—the relevant auction—they average more than twice the size of the auctions. By contrast, the relative size of the settlement volume would be about a third less if it were compared to the closing auctions on the third Fridays. As documented in the DERA Staff PM Pilot Memo, p.m.-settled option activities only have a very small impact on the volatility of the underlying index. Additionally, the size of the option settlement value is relatively small compared with the size of the closing auction value. Therefore, the Exchange believes that it is difficult to manipulate the underlying Nasdaq-100 Index during the closing auction. The equity closing auctions have grown to be substantial liquidity events (for the period examined the closing auction volume is larger than the opening auction volume) and would therefore be suited for handling the excess liquidity demand created by index options settlement.</P>

The Exchange observed a consistent decrease in relative quoted spread is observed from 2017 to 2022 for NDX options. When the Exchange compared the spread trend of NDX monthly contracts to that of QQQ monthly contracts, the results suggest that there is gradual decrease in both the NDX monthly contracts spread and the QQQ contracts spread during the sample period.

-                <P>The Exchange also considered whether the move from a.m.-settlement to p.m.-settlement for Friday weeklies (NDX-Weekly to NDXP-Fri) led to changes in spreads for those contracts. Overall, the Exchange sees no evidence of deterioration of spreads associated with the changes the Exchange has made to its Nasdaq-100 Index product offering by introducing p.m.-settled products.</P>
-                <P>Finally, in considering impact on the closing process in equity markets, the Exchange concluded that it is difficult to manipulate the underlying Nasdaq-100 Index. Specifically, the equity closing auctions have grown to be substantial liquidity events that are much larger than the opening auctions, and would therefore be better suited for handling the excess liquidity demand created by index options settlement. The Exchange believes the expiration of p.m.-settlement options would not adversely affect the options market or the underlying cash equities market.</P>
-                <P>Further, the Exchange has sufficient systems capacity to handle p.m.-settled options on broad-based indexes with nonstandard expirations dates and has not encountered any issues or adverse market effects as a result of listing them.</P>
-                <P>Accordingly, the Exchange believes that weekly expirations and EOMs, including the NQX expirations, in the p.m.-settled products should create greater trading and hedging opportunities and flexibility and provide customers with the ability to more closely tailor their investment objectives.</P>

-                <P>Additionally, the Exchange does not believe the proposal will impose any burden on intermarket competition as market participants are welcome to become Members and trade at ISE if they determine that this proposed rule change has made ISE more attractive or favorable.

(the “Exchange” or “EDGA”) proposes to amend Rule 11.9(a)(4) to provide that a change in position from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) will result in a loss of time priority if made when a short sale circuit breaker pursuant to Rule 201 of Regulation SHO is in effect. The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 11.10(e)(3) to provide that orders may be modified from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using a Replace Message. Additionally, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 11.11(a) to clarify when the Exchange may route orders with a short sale instruction when a short sale circuit breaker pursuant to Rule 201 of Regulation SHO is in effect.

-                    The Exchange first proposes to amend Rule 11.10(e)(3) to provide that an order's position may be modified from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) through the use of a Replace Message. The Exchange notes that Users complete a position modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using the same functionality to mark an order as either sell long or sell short under Rule 11.10(e)(3). The Exchange believes this change will provide additional specificity to the rule and ensure the rule uses terminology consistent with the description of Replace Messages and their impact on an order's priority under Exchange Rule 11.9(a)(4) (discussed 
-                    <E T="03">infra</E>

-                    The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 11.9(a)(4) in order to align the Rule text with how the System currently behaves when an SSCB is in effect, and to provide clarification to Users that when an SSCB is in effect that changing an order's position from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) will 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13199"/>
-                    instead result in such order receiving a new timestamp and losing its original priority. The Exchange is not proposing to change the timestamp for modifications from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) when an SSCB is 
-                    <E T="03">not</E>
-                     in effect. Additionally, the Exchange is also proposing to add language to Rule 11.9(a)(4) stating that a modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) is a type of order modification that would retain time priority and would not receive a new timestamp, regardless of whether an SSCB is in effect (discussed 
-                    <E T="03">infra</E>

-                    The Exchange also proposes a non-substantive change to Rule 11.9(a)(4) to provide that an order is being modified by a Replace Message rather than cancelled and replaced with a new order. This change is intended to provide that an order does not need to be cancelled and replaced with a new order, but rather includes modifications to orders via the use of a Replace Message. The proposed changes to Exchange Rule 11.9(a)(4) are based on previously-approved changes to MIAX Pearl Rule 2616(a)(5), which is substantially similar to Exchange Rule 11.9(a)(4).

-                    In the event that a User requests an order modification using a Replace Message, the System will first determine whether the modification is of a kind that may result in a loss of time priority in order to determine how the modification will be handled by the System. For example, as noted in Exchange Rule 11.9(a)(4), a modification to the price of an order will cause the loss of time priority. Therefore, in the event of a modification of the price of an order, the System will first determine that the type of modification may result in a loss of time priority and then handle the order accordingly by giving it a new timestamp.

-                    <FTREF/>
-                     Since an order modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may result in a change in price of the order when an SSCB is in effect, the Exchange immediately gives the order a new timestamp. As previously discussed, a modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or a modification from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) requires the System to determine whether an order must be re-priced to be compliant with the requirements of Regulation SHO. The Exchange notes, however, that an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) does not require the System to determine whether the order shall be re-priced as a result of the modification, as both a sell long and a sell short exempt order may execute at a more aggressive price than a sell short order when an SSCB is in effect. Given that the System does not have to evaluate whether a price change is required as part of an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa), this specific order modification does not lose priority on the EDGA Book.

-                         Alternatively, as noted in Rule 11.9(a)(4) a modification that involves a decrease in the size of the order will not cause the loss of time priority. Therefore, in order to decrease the size of the order, the System will first determine that the type of modification will not result in a loss of time priority and will handle the order in a completely different manner than it would if the order would have resulted in a loss of time priority.

-                    Specifically, if a sell long order is modified to a sell short order (or vice versa) or a sell short exempt order is modified to a sell short order (or vice versa) while an SSCB is in effect, the Exchange cannot simply change the order from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) while resting on the book, but rather must verify that the sell short order would not violate Rule 201(b)(1)(ii)

-                     of Regulation SHO before the order is re-added to the EDGA Book. Therefore, as such a modification may result in a change of the order's price, the System gives the order a new timestamp, resulting in a loss of priority. Similarly, if a sell short order is modified to a sell long order (or vice versa) or a sell short order is modified to a sell short exempt (or vice versa) order while an SSCB is in effect, the order may be eligible to display at a more aggressive price. As such, the System gives the order a new timestamp, again resulting in a loss of time priority, but potentially in improved price priority. However, if an order is modified from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) when an SSCB is in effect, the System does not have to take an additional step to evaluate whether the modification violates Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO given that sell long and sell short exempt orders may execute at more aggressive prices that sell short orders during an SSCB. Accordingly, an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) would not result in a loss of priority. Stated differently, the System treats orders marked sell long and sell short exempt the same, and only order modifications from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) would cause an order to lose priority during an SSCB because the System is required to determine whether a change in the order's price is required as a consequence of the change in status from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa). This order price analysis by the System is required in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO as orders may be required to be re-priced to prevent potential violations of Rule 201 when the SSCB is in effect.

-                     is $5.00 × $5.10 while an SSCB is in effect. A User enters a non-displayed sell long order with a limit price of $5.00. Subsequently, the User modifies the position of the order from sell long to sell short, while the NBBO has remained the same. In order to effect the modification, the System determines that a modification from sell long to sell short may result in a change in the order's price in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, as orders may be required to be repriced to prevent potential violations of Rule 201 when the SSCB is in effect. Accordingly, the order loses its time priority in order for the System to handle the potential price change. In this example, the subject order resulted in a change of the order's price as the sell short order was not eligible for execution at a price equal to the NBB. Nonetheless, even if the modification would not have ultimately resulted in a price change, the modification would have necessarily caused the System to evaluate whether a price change was necessary and, thus, required a new timestamp, resulting in a loss of time priority.

-                    sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB would result in a loss of time priority, and as a result, certain sell short orders could be permitted to display or execute at an impermissible price that would not comply with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii). The Exchange's process is designed to ensure compliance with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO and is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. As designed, during an SSCB, the System determines up front whether an order modification could result in a price change before it can properly effect the modification. If the modification is of a type that may result in a price change to comply with Regulation SHO, the System gives the order a new timestamp. As a result, such a modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) always results in a loss of time priority even if the modification did not result in a change of the order's price. Conversely, an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) does not result in an order losing priority because the System does not conduct an order price analysis to ensure compliance with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO as both sell long and sell short exempt orders may execute at more aggressive prices than sell short orders during an SSCB.

-                    Moreover, the Exchange processes billions of order modifications each month, with only a limited amount of modifications involving a change from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB. Out of the billions of order modifications processed by the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges during the months of May, June, and July 2022, the Exchange identified approximately 369,884 order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) across the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges during an SSCB that would potentially be affected by the proposed amendment to Rule 11.9(a)(4).

-                     Given that 369,884 order modifications during an SSCB across the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges is an extremely small percentage of the billions of order modifications that the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges processed during the months of May, June, and July 2022, the Exchange believes that any benefit from restoring priority to this limited amount of order modifications is outweighed by the burden of changing the System to be able to conduct an order price analysis in real time to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO and to permit these orders to retain priority.

-                <P>The proposed amendment to Rule 11.10(e)(3) is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because it does not seek to change how order modifications from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) are accomplished. Instead, the proposed change provides clarity to Users that a position change from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may be accomplished through the use of a Replace Message and does not require an order to be cancelled and a new order submitted in order to modify an order's position to sell short exempt. The proposed change to Rule 11.10(e)(3) will also provide continuity between Rule 11.10(e)(3) and the proposed changes to Rule 11.9(a)(4), and as such are directly intended to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and national market system.</P>
-                <P>The proposed change to Rule 11.9(a)(4) removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because it addresses a limited scenario when a User modifies an order's position using a Replace Message during an SSCB. The proposed rule change specifically states that orders whose positions are modified from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using a Replace Message when an SSCB is in effect will not lose priority as compared to other orders on the EDGA Book. Further, the proposed rule change provides that order modifications from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) using a Replace Message will not lose priority as compared to other orders on the EDGA Book, regardless of whether an SSCB is in effect. Additionally, the proposed change to Rule 11.9(a)(4) removes impediments to and perfects a free and open market system because it is designed to make clear to Users that orders may be modified using a Replace Message without losing priority subject to the limitations named in Rule 11.9(a)(4). This change does not amend the meaning or operation of Rule 11.9(a)(4).</P>

-                    The proposed changes to Rule 11.11(a) are designed to clarify that any sell short order that will post to an away Trading Center will be routed when an SSCB is in effect. In addition, providing Users the ability to send sell short orders that will post to an away Trading Center, and thus are routable when an SSCB is in effect provides them additional flexibility with regard to the handling of their orders, and may provide additional execution opportunities for those orders. Given this, the proposed amendments to Rule 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13202"/>
-                    11.11(a) are directly targeted at removing impediments to and perfecting the mechanism of a free and open market and national market system, as well as to assure fair competition among brokers and dealers and among exchange markets.
-                </P>
-                <P>The proposed change to Rule 11.11(a) further promotes just and equitable principles of trade and perfects a free and open market system by identifying which orders containing routing instructions are eligible to route and post to an away market center during an SSCB. As all Trading Centers are required to comply with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, a User can expect that an order routed from the Exchange to an away market center will be treated similarly on the away market center as it would on the Exchange during an SSCB. There is no change to the meaning or operation of this rule, but rather an amendment to make clear that an order that is eligible to post to an away market may be routed during an SSCB.</P>
-                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
-                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act as the proposed rule changes are not being proposed for competitive reasons. Rather, the proposed amendment to Rule 11.10(e)(3) provides that modifications from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may be accomplished through the use of a Replace Message. This proposed amendment will not change existing System behavior and Users will have more certainty about how orders may be modified, which is related to the proposed changes to Rule 11.9(a)(4). Order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) use the same Replace Message functionality as a modification from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa), and amending Rule 11.10(e)(3) to describe this behavior for Users is directly related to the Exchange's proposed changes to Rule 11.9(a)(4) and does not impose a burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act.</P>
-                <P>Additionally, the proposed amendments to Rule 11.9(a)(4) will enhance the transparency of the rules by revising the rule text. By revising the rule text to align with the current System behavior, Users will be aware that if they modify their orders from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) and an SSCB is in effect, their orders will be given a new timestamp and lose time priority. Users are free to consider this proposed change as part of their overall experience with the Exchange, which also includes execution quality and functionality offerings, when making order routing decisions. Additionally, the Exchange notes that the proposed rule change applies equally to all Users, and all Users' orders are subject to the described functionality, regardless of their size. Users may not opt-out of this System functionality.</P>
-                <P>Furthermore, this loss of time priority for a position modification would only occur when an SSCB is in effect and the Exchange is required to comply with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO. The impact of an order modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using a Replace Message during an SSCB with respect to loss of time priority is no different than when a User seeks to increase the size of their order using a Replace Message or when a User seeks to change the position of their order by cancelling the existing order and entering a new order. In each instance, the order will receive a new timestamp reflecting the time the modification was made and the order would lose priority as compared to other orders on the EDGA Book.</P>
-                <P>
-                    Furthermore, the proposed change to Rule 11.9(a)(4) does not impose any burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act in that the proposed change does not present a novel approach to sell short order handling. Indeed, the proposed changes to Rule 11.9(a)(4) are consistent with a recently approved amendment

The Exchange's proposed Rule is also similar to MIAX Pearl Rule 2616(a) in that modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) and modifications from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) will be subject to a loss of priority during an SSCB.

The Exchange's System does not view an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) as a type of change which requires an order price analysis in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, and as such does not cause these types of order modifications to result in a loss of priority.</P>

-                     In each instance mentioned above, the original order would need to be replaced with a new order and therefore would receive a new timestamp which would result in a loss of priority. The Exchange is seeking to only append a new timestamp and cause a loss of priority as compared to other orders on the EDGA Book when an order's position is modified from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB, which is more narrowly-tailored than the rules governing similar order behavior on MIAX Pearl, IEX and Nasdaq.

This proposed change is not being proposed for competitive reasons, but rather to make clear that any order eligible to be posted to an away market center will be routed during an SSCB. As each market center is required to comply with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO, the Exchange believes that any order eligible to be posted to an away market center should be permitted to route, as the order would be subject to the away market center's rules regarding compliance with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO upon posting.

The Exchange believes this change will provide additional specificity to the rule and ensure the rule uses terminology consistent with the description of Replace Messages and their impact on an order's priority under Exchange Rule 11.9(a)(4) (discussed 
-                    <E T="03">infra</E>

-                    The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 11.9(a)(4) in order to align the Rule text with how the System currently behaves when an SSCB is in effect, and to provide clarification to Users that when an SSCB is in effect that changing an order's position from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) will instead result in such order receiving a new timestamp and losing its original priority. The Exchange is not proposing to change the timestamp for modifications from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) when an SSCB is 
-                    <E T="03">not</E>
-                     in effect. Additionally, the Exchange is also proposing to add language to Rule 11.9(a)(4) stating that a modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) is a type of order modification that would retain time priority and would not receive a new timestamp, regardless of whether an SSCB is in effect (discussed 
-                    <E T="03">infra</E>

-                    The Exchange also proposes a non-substantive change to Rule 11.9(a)(4) to provide that an order is being modified by a Replace Message rather than cancelled and replaced with a new order. This change is intended to provide that an order does not need to be cancelled and replaced with a new order, but rather includes modifications to orders via the use of a Replace Message. The proposed changes to Exchange Rule 11.9(a)(4) are based on previously-approved changes to MIAX Pearl Rule 2616(a)(5), which is substantially similar to Exchange Rule 11.9(a)(4).

-                    In the event that a User requests an order modification using a Replace Message, the System will first determine whether the modification is of a kind that may result in a loss of time priority in order to determine how the modification will be handled by the System. For example, as noted in Exchange Rule 11.9(a)(4), a modification to the price of an order will cause the loss of time priority. Therefore, in the event of a modification of the price of an order, the System will first determine that the type of modification may result in a loss of time priority and then handle the order accordingly by giving it a new timestamp.

-                    <FTREF/>
-                     Since an order modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may result in a change in price of the order when an SSCB is in effect, the Exchange immediately gives the order a new timestamp. As previously discussed, a modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or a modification from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) requires the System to determine whether an order must be re-priced to be compliant with the requirements of Regulation SHO. The Exchange notes, however, that an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) does not require the System to determine whether the order shall be re-priced as a result of the modification, as both a sell long and a sell short exempt order may execute at a more aggressive price than a sell short order when an SSCB is in effect. Given that the System does not have to evaluate whether a price change is required as part of an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa), this specific order modification does not lose priority on the EDGX Book.

-                         Alternatively, as noted in Rule 11.9(a)(4) a modification that involves a decrease in the size of the order will not cause the loss of time priority. Therefore, in order to decrease the size of the order, the System will first determine that the type of modification will not result in a loss of time priority and will handle the order in a completely different manner than it would if the order would have resulted in a loss of time priority.

-                    Specifically, if a sell long order is modified to a sell short order (or vice versa) or a sell short exempt order is modified to a sell short order (or vice versa) while an SSCB is in effect, the Exchange cannot simply change the order from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) while resting on the book, but rather must verify that the sell short order would not violate Rule 201(b)(1)(ii)

-                    <FTREF/>
-                     of Regulation SHO before the order is re-added to the EDGX Book. Therefore, as such a modification may result in a change of the order's price, the System gives the order a new timestamp, resulting in a loss of priority. Similarly, if a sell short order is modified to a sell long order (or vice versa) or a sell short order is modified to a sell short exempt (or vice versa) order while an SSCB is in effect, the order may be eligible to display at a more aggressive price. As such, the System gives the order a new timestamp, again resulting in a loss of time priority, but potentially in improved price priority. However, if an order is modified from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) when an SSCB is in effect, the System does not have to take an additional step to evaluate whether the modification violates Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO given that sell long and sell short exempt orders may execute at more aggressive prices that sell short orders during an SSCB. Accordingly, an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) would not result in a loss of priority. Stated differently, the System treats orders marked sell long and sell short exempt the same, and only order modifications from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) would cause an order to lose priority during an SSCB because the System is required to determine whether a change in the order's price is required as a consequence of the change in status from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa). This order price analysis by the System is required in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO as orders may be required to be re-priced to prevent potential violations of Rule 201 when the SSCB is in effect.

-                <P>To illustrate order behavior with a modification from sell long to sell short during an SSCB, consider the following example:</P>

-                    Assume the National Best Bid and Offer (“NBBO”) 
-                    <SU>15</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>

-                    <SU>16</SU>

-                     is $5.00 × $5.10 while an SSCB is in effect. A User enters a non-displayed sell long order with a limit price of $5.00. Subsequently, the User modifies the position of the order from sell long to sell short, while the NBBO has remained the same. In order to effect the modification, the System determines that a modification from sell long to sell short may result in a change in the order's price in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, as orders may be required to be repriced to prevent potential violations of Rule 201 when the SSCB is in effect. Accordingly, the order loses its time priority in order for the System to handle the potential price change. In this example, the subject order resulted in a change of the order's price as the sell short order was not eligible for execution at a price equal to the NBB. Nonetheless, even if the modification would not have ultimately resulted in a price change, the modification would have necessarily caused the System to evaluate whether a price change was necessary and, thus, required a new timestamp, resulting in a loss of time priority.

-                <P>In particular, the proposed rule change to Rule 11.10(e)(3) is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because it aligns the rule text with the how the System currently operates and helps to eliminate any potential confusion Users may have regarding current Rule 11.10(e)(3). This proposed amendment will not change existing System behavior and Users will have more certainty about how orders may be modified, which is related to the proposed changes to Rule 11.9(a)(4).</P>
-                <P>
-                    Additionally, the proposed rule change to Rule 11.9(a)(4) is designed to ensure all sell short orders are subjected to the Exchange's process for ensuring that the order would not violate Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO during an SSCB. In order to verify the displayed price of an order with a position modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB, the System handles the modification as if a price change would occur, even if the modification does not ultimately result in a price change. If the System permitted such order modifications to forego this process, no order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB would result in a loss of time priority, and as a result, certain sell short orders could be permitted to display or execute at an impermissible price that would not comply with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii). The Exchange's process is 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13207"/>
-                    designed to ensure compliance with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO and is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. As designed, during an SSCB, the System determines up front whether an order modification could result in a price change before it can properly effect the modification. If the modification is of a type that may result in a price change to comply with Regulation SHO, the System gives the order a new timestamp. As a result, such a modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) always results in a loss of time priority even if the modification did not result in a change of the order's price. Conversely, an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) does not result in an order losing priority because the System does not conduct an order price analysis to ensure compliance with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO as both sell long and sell short exempt orders may execute at more aggressive prices than sell short orders during an SSCB.

-                    Moreover, the Exchange processes billions of order modifications each month, with only a limited amount of modifications involving a change from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB. Out of the billions of order modifications processed by the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges during the months of May, June, and July 2022, the Exchange identified approximately 369,884 order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) across the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges during an SSCB that would potentially be affected by the proposed amendment to Rule 11.9(a)(4).

-                    <FTREF/>
-                     Given that 369,884 order modifications during an SSCB across the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges is an extremely small percentage of the billions of order modifications that the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges processed during the months of May, June, and July 2022, the Exchange believes that any benefit from restoring priority to this limited amount of order modifications is outweighed by the burden of changing the System to be able to conduct an order price analysis in real time to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO and to permit these orders to retain priority.

-                <P>The proposed amendment to Rule 11.10(e)(3) is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because it does not seek to change how order modifications from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) are accomplished. Instead, the proposed change provides clarity to Users that a position change from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may be accomplished through the use of a Replace Message and does not require an order to be cancelled and a new order submitted in order to modify an order's position to sell short exempt. The proposed change to Rule 11.10(e)(3) will also provide continuity between Rule 11.10(e)(3) and the proposed changes to Rule 11.9(a)(4), and as such are directly intended to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and national market system.</P>
-                <P>The proposed change to Rule 11.9(a)(4) removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because it addresses a limited scenario when a User modifies an order's position using a Replace Message during an SSCB. The proposed rule change specifically states that orders whose positions are modified from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using a Replace Message when an SSCB is in effect will not lose priority as compared to other orders on the EDGX Book. Further, the proposed rule change provides that order modifications from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) using a Replace Message will not lose priority as compared to other orders on the EDGX Book, regardless of whether an SSCB is in effect. Additionally, the proposed change to Rule 11.9(a)(4) removes impediments to and perfects a free and open market system because it is designed to make clear to Users that orders may be modified using a Replace Message without losing priority subject to the limitations named in Rule 11.9(a)(4). This change does not amend the meaning or operation of Rule 11.9(a)(4).</P>

-                    The proposed changes to Rule 11.11(a) are designed to clarify that any sell short order that will post to an away Trading Center will be routed when an SSCB is in effect. In addition, providing Users the ability to send sell short orders that will post to an away Trading Center, and thus are routable when an SSCB is in effect provides them additional flexibility with regard to the handling of their orders, and may provide additional execution opportunities for those orders. Given this, the proposed amendments to Rule 11.11(a) are directly targeted at removing impediments to and perfecting the mechanism of a free and open market and national market system, as well as to assure fair competition among brokers and dealers and among exchange markets.

-                <P>The proposed change to Rule 11.11(a) further promotes just and equitable principles of trade and perfects a free and open market system by identifying which orders containing routing instructions are eligible to route and post to an away market center during an SSCB. As all Trading Centers are required to comply with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, a User can expect that an order routed from the Exchange to an away market center will be treated similarly on the away market center as it would on the Exchange during an SSCB. There is no change to the meaning or operation of this rule, but rather an amendment to make clear that an order that is eligible to post to an away market may be routed during an SSCB.</P>
-                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
-                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act as the proposed rule changes are not being proposed for competitive reasons. Rather, the proposed amendment to Rule 11.10(e)(3) provides that modifications from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may be accomplished through the use of a Replace Message. This proposed amendment will not change existing System behavior and Users will have more certainty about how orders may be modified, which is related to the proposed changes to Rule 11.9(a)(4). Order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) use the same Replace Message functionality as a modification from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa), and amending Rule 11.10(e)(3) to describe this behavior for Users is directly related to the Exchange's proposed changes to Rule 11.9(a)(4) and does not impose a burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act.</P>
-                <P>Additionally, the proposed amendments to Rule 11.9(a)(4) will enhance the transparency of the rules by revising the rule text. By revising the rule text to align with the current System behavior, Users will be aware that if they modify their orders from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) and an SSCB is in effect, their orders will be given a new timestamp and lose time priority. Users are free to consider this proposed change as part of their overall experience with the Exchange, which also includes execution quality and functionality offerings, when making order routing decisions. Additionally, the Exchange notes that the proposed rule change applies equally to all Users, and all Users' orders are subject to the described functionality, regardless of their size. Users may not opt-out of this System functionality.</P>
-                <P>Furthermore, this loss of time priority for a position modification would only occur when an SSCB is in effect and the Exchange is required to comply with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO. The impact of an order modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using a Replace Message during an SSCB with respect to loss of time priority is no different than when a User seeks to increase the size of their order using a Replace Message or when a User seeks to change the position of their order by cancelling the existing order and entering a new order. In each instance, the order will receive a new timestamp reflecting the time the modification was made and the order would lose priority as compared to other orders on the EDGX Book.</P>
-                <P>
-                    Furthermore, the proposed change to Rule 11.9(a)(4) does not impose any burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act in that the proposed change does not present a novel approach to sell short order handling. Indeed, the proposed changes to Rule 11.9(a)(4) are consistent with a recently approved amendment

The Exchange's proposed Rule is also similar to MIAX Pearl Rule 2616(a) in that modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) and modifications from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) will be subject to a loss of priority during an SSCB.

The Exchange's System does not view an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) as a type of change which requires an order price analysis in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, and as such does not cause these types of order modifications to result in a loss of priority.</P>

-                    In addition, the proposed rule change is more narrowly tailored than the rules of Investors Exchange LLC (“IEX”), which requires market participants to enter a new order where an order's position is changed even when an SSCB is not in effect

-                     In each instance mentioned above, the original order would need to be replaced with a new order and therefore would receive a new timestamp which would result in a loss of priority.

-                    Furthermore, the proposed change to Rule 11.11(a) does not impose any burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act as it makes clear that orders that may post to away market centers will be routed during an SSCB. Users will have the ability to take this factor into consideration when determining which routing strategy to use when entering an order on the Exchange and are able to consider this proposed change as part of their overall 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13209"/>
-                    experience with the Exchange. If a User disfavors this proposed change they are free to use a different routing strategy or submit an order directly to an away market center. This proposed change is not being proposed for competitive reasons, but rather to make clear that any order eligible to be posted to an away market center will be routed during an SSCB. As each market center is required to comply with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO, the Exchange believes that any order eligible to be posted to an away market center should be permitted to route, as the order would be subject to the away market center's rules regarding compliance with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO upon posting.

In addition, Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii) requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.

-                    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b–4(f)(6) normally does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
-                    <SU>39</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     the Commission may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay. The Exchange states the proposed rule change provides clarity on how orders modified to sell short exempt are accomplished and the priority of orders marked sell short exempt. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change related to modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) that occur during an SSCB will affect only a small percentage of overall order modifications.

-                     Finally, the Exchange states that the proposed change to Rule 11.11(a) will permit orders containing routing instructions entered by all Users that would post to an away market during an SSCB to route to away market centers immediately upon becoming operative. The Commission believes that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because the proposed rule change does not raise any new or novel issues. Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the operative delay and designates the proposal operative upon filing.

Therefore, the Exchange is submitting this proposal in order to list and trade shares (“Shares”) as Active Proxy Portfolio Shares of the JPMorgan Active Small Cap Value ETF (the “Fund”) under Rule 8.601–E.

Rule 8.601–E(c)(1) provides that “[t]he term “Active Proxy Portfolio Share” means a security that (a) is issued by a investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company”) organized as an open-end management investment company that invests in a portfolio of securities selected by the Investment Company's investment adviser consistent with the Investment Company's investment objectives and policies; (b) is issued in a specified minimum number of shares, or multiples thereof, in return for a deposit by the purchaser of the Proxy Portfolio or Custom Basket, as applicable, and/or cash with a value equal to the next determined net asset value (“NAV”); (c) when aggregated in the same specified minimum number of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares, or multiples thereof, may be redeemed at a holder's request in return for the Proxy Portfolio or Custom Basket, as applicable, and/or cash to the holder by the issuer with a value equal to the next determined NAV; and (d) the portfolio holdings for which are disclosed within at least 60 days following the end of every fiscal quarter.” Rule 8.601–E(c)(2) provides that “[t]he term “Actual Portfolio” means the identities and quantities of the securities and other assets held by the Investment Company that shall form the basis for the Investment Company's calculation of NAV at the end of the business day.” Rule 8.601–E(c)(3) provides that “[t]he term “Proxy Portfolio” means a specified portfolio of securities, other financial instruments and/or cash designed to track closely the daily performance of the Actual Portfolio of a series of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares as provided in the exemptive relief pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 applicable to such series.” Rule 8.601–E(c)(4) provides that “the term `Custom Basket' means a portfolio of securities that is different from the Proxy Portfolio and is otherwise consistent with the exemptive relief issued pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 applicable to a series of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares.”

-                    While funds issuing Active Proxy Portfolio Shares will be actively-managed and, to that extent, will be similar to Managed Fund Shares, Active Proxy Portfolio Shares differ from Managed Fund Shares in the following important respects. First, in contrast to Managed Fund Shares, which are actively-managed funds listed and traded under NYSE Arca Rule 8.600–E

-                    <FTREF/>
-                     the portfolio for an issue of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares will be publicly disclosed within at least 60 days following the end of every fiscal quarter in accordance with normal disclosure requirements otherwise applicable to open-end management investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”).
-                    <SU>7</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     The composition of the portfolio of an issue of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares would not be available at commencement of Exchange listing and trading. Second, in connection with the creation and redemption of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares, such creation or redemption may be exchanged for a Proxy Portfolio or Custom Basket, as applicable, and/or cash with a value equal to the next-determined NAV. A series of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares will disclose the Proxy Portfolio on a daily basis, which, as described above, is designed to track closely the daily performance of the Actual Portfolio of a series of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares, instead of the actual holdings of the Investment Company, as provided by a series of Managed Fund Shares. As set forth in NYSE Arca Rule 8.601–E(d)(2)(B)(ii), for Active Proxy Portfolio Shares using a Custom Basket, each Business Day,

-                    Commentary .04 to NYSE Arca Rule 8.601–E provides that, if the investment adviser to the Investment Company issuing Active Proxy Portfolio Shares is registered as a broker-dealer or is affiliated with a broker-dealer, such investment adviser will erect and maintain a “fire wall” between the investment adviser and personnel of the broker-dealer or broker-dealer affiliate, as applicable, with respect to access to information concerning the composition and/or changes to such Investment Company's Actual Portfolio, Proxy Portfolio, and/or Custom Basket, as applicable. Any person related to the investment adviser or Investment Company who makes decisions pertaining to the Investment Company's Actual Portfolio, Proxy Portfolio, and/or Custom Basket, as applicable, or has access to non-public information regarding the Investment Company's Actual Portfolio, Proxy Portfolio, and/or the Custom Basket, as applicable, or changes thereto must be subject to procedures reasonably designed to prevent the use and dissemination of material non-public information regarding the Actual Portfolio, Proxy Portfolio, and/or the Custom Basket, as applicable, or changes thereto. Commentary .04 is similar to Commentary .03(a)(i) and (iii) to NYSE Arca Rule 5.2–E(j)(3); however, Commentary .04, in connection with the establishment of a “fire wall” between the investment adviser and the broker-dealer, reflects the applicable open-end fund's portfolio, not an underlying benchmark index, as is the case with index-based funds.

-                         An investment adviser to an open-end fund is required to be registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). As a result, the Adviser and its related personnel will be subject to the provisions of Rule 204A–1 under the Advisers Act relating to codes of ethics. This Rule requires investment advisers to adopt a code of ethics that reflects the fiduciary nature of the relationship to clients as well as compliance with other applicable securities laws. Accordingly, procedures designed to prevent the communication and misuse of non-public information by an investment adviser must be consistent with Rule 204A–1 under the Advisers Act. In addition, Rule 206(4)–7 under the Advisers Act makes it unlawful for an investment adviser to provide investment advice to clients unless such investment adviser has (i) adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations, by the investment adviser and its supervised persons, of the Advisers Act and the Commission rules adopted thereunder; (ii) implemented, at a minimum, an annual review regarding the adequacy of the policies and procedures established pursuant to subparagraph (i) above and the effectiveness of their implementation; and (iii) designated an individual (who is a supervised person) responsible for administering the policies and procedures adopted under subparagraph (i) above.

-                    According to the Registration Statement, the Fund will generate a Proxy Portfolio that will be designed to closely track the daily performance of the Fund but will not be the Fund's Actual Portfolio.

The Proxy Portfolio will include only certain securities that trade on a national securities exchange contemporaneously that trade on a national securities exchange contemporaneously [sic] with the Fund's Shares. The Fund will publish on its website the Proxy Portfolio before the commencement of trading of the Fund's Shares on each Business Day. In addition to the Proxy Portfolio, the Fund will disclose daily the percentage weight overlap between the holdings of the Proxy Portfolio and the Actual Portfolio that formed the basis for the Fund's calculation of NAV at the end of the prior Business Day (“Proxy Overlap”) and the standard deviation over the past three months of the daily proxy spread (

Daily disclosure of the Proxy Portfolio, the Proxy Overlap, the Tracking Error and the other related proxy portfolio information is designed to ensure that investors can purchase and sell Fund shares in the secondary market at prices that are at or close to the underlying NAV per share of the Fund by enabling Authorized Participants and other market participants to accurately assess the profitability of arbitrage trades in Shares of the Fund.

-                <P>According to the Registration Statement, Shares of the Fund may be acquired or redeemed directly from the Fund only in specified minimum size “Creation Units” as defined below or multiples thereof. The Fund will offer and issue Shares at the applicable NAV to broker-dealers and other financial intermediaries who are participants in the National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) and who have signed an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Distributor (each, an “Authorized Participant”), and accepted by the Distributor, only in aggregations of a specified number of Shares (“Creation Units”), in exchange for a basket of securities and/or instruments (the “Deposit Securities”), together with a deposit of a specified cash payment (the “Cash Component”). The NAV of the Fund's Shares will be calculated each Business Day as of the close of regular trading on the Exchange, ordinarily 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (“E.T.”). A Creation Unit will consist of at least 5,000 Shares.</P>
-                <P>In certain circumstances, the Fund may issue Creation Units solely in exchange for a specified all-cash payment (“Cash Deposit”). Shares of the Fund are likewise redeemable by the Fund only in Creation Units, generally in exchange for a basket of securities and instruments (“Redemption Securities”), together with a Cash Component. The names and quantities of the securities and instruments that constitute the Deposit Securities and Redemption Securities are generally the same as the Fund's Proxy Portfolio, except to the extent purchases and redemptions are made entirely or partially on a cash basis. In addition, the Fund may determine to use Custom Baskets that differ from the Proxy Portfolio in that they include instruments that are not in the Proxy Portfolio, or are included in the Proxy Portfolio but in different weightings. As with the offer and sale of Creation Units, the Fund may, in certain circumstances, redeem Creation Units in exchange for a specified all-cash payment.</P>
-                <P>
-                    In order to initiate a creation order for a Creation Unit, an Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to purchase Shares in proper form to the Distributor by the close of regular trading on the NYSE, typically 3:00 p.m. E.T. on a Business Day for creation of Creation Units to be effected based on the NAV of Shares of the Fund on that Business Day. The date on which an order to create Creation Units (or an order to redeem Creation Units, as discussed below) is placed is referred to 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13214"/>
-                    as the “Transmittal Date.” Orders must be transmitted by an Authorized Participant via the electronic order entry system, by telephone or other transmission method acceptable to JPMorgan Chase Bank and the Distributor pursuant to procedures set forth in the Authorized Participant Agreement.
-                </P>
-                <P>Fund Shares may be redeemed only in Creation Units at the NAV next determined after receipt of a redemption request in proper form and only on a Business Day. The redemption proceeds for a Creation Unit will generally consist of securities represented in the Proxy Portfolio or a Custom Basket (such securities, “Fund Security” or “Fund Securities”) plus cash in an amount equal to the difference between the NAV of the Creation Unit being redeemed, as next determined after a receipt of a request in proper form, and the value of the Fund Securities, minus any fees. The Fund may substitute a “cash-in-lieu” amount to replace any Fund Security in certain limited circumstances. The amount of cash paid out in such cases will be equivalent to the value of the instrument listed as a Fund Security. In the event that the Fund Securities have a value greater than the NAV of the Creation Unit, a compensating cash payment equal to the difference will be included in the Cash Component required to be delivered by an Authorized Participant. In order to initiate a redemption order for a Creation Unit to be effected based on the NAV of Shares of the Fund on that Business Day, an Authorized Participant must submit an irrevocable order to redeem the Creation Unit in proper form to the Distributor by the close of regular trading on the NYSE, typically 3:00 p.m. E.T. on that Business Day.</P>

Trading may be halted because of market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in the series of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares inadvisable. These may include: (a) the extent to which trading is not occurring in the securities and/or the financial instruments composing the Proxy Portfolio and/or Actual Portfolio; or (b) whether other unusual conditions or circumstances detrimental to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market are present. If the Exchange becomes aware that the NAV, Proxy Portfolio, or Actual Portfolio with respect to a series of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares is not disseminated to all market participants at the same time, the Exchange shall halt trading in such series until such time as the NAV, Proxy Portfolio, or Actual Portfolio is available to all market participants at the same time.

The Exchange will require from the issuer of a series of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares, upon initial listing and periodically thereafter, a representation that it is in compliance with Rule 8.601–E. The Exchange notes that Commentary .01 to Rule 8.601–E requires an issuer of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares to notify the Exchange of any failure to comply with the continued listing requirements of Rule 8.601–E. In addition, the Exchange will require the issuer to represent that it will notify the Exchange of any failure to comply with the terms of applicable exemptive and no-action relief.

In addition, Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii) requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.

-                    A proposed rule change filed pursuant to Rule 19b–4(f)(6) under the Act normally does not become operative for 30 days after the date of its filing. However, Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii) 
-                    <SU>31</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     permits the Commission to designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has requested that the Commission waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposal may become operative immediately upon filing. The Exchange notes that the Commission has approved and noticed for immediate effectiveness proposed rule changes to permit listing and trading on the Exchange of Active Proxy Portfolio Shares similar to the Fund.
-                    <SU>32</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     The proposed listing rule for the Fund raises no novel legal or regulatory issues. Thus, the Commission believes that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the 30-day operative delay and designates the proposed rule change operative upon filing.

-                    The Exchange first proposes to amend Rule 11.9(e)(3) to provide that an order's position may be modified from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) through the use of a Replace Message. The Exchange notes that Users complete a position modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using the same functionality to mark an order as either sell long or sell short under Rule 11.9(e)(3). The Exchange believes this change will provide additional specificity to the rule and ensure the rule uses terminology consistent with the description of Replace Messages and their impact on an order's priority under Exchange Rule 11.12(a)(4) (discussed 
-                    <E T="03">infra</E>

-                    The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 11.12(a)(4) in order to align the Rule text with how the System currently behaves when an SSCB is in effect, and to provide clarification to Users that when an SSCB is in effect that changing an order's position from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) will instead result in such order receiving a new timestamp and losing its original priority. The Exchange is not proposing to change the timestamp for modifications from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) when an SSCB is 
-                    <E T="03">not</E>
-                     in effect. Additionally, the Exchange is also proposing to add language to Rule 11.12(a)(4) stating that a modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) is a type of order modification that would retain time priority and would not receive a new timestamp, regardless of whether an SSCB is in effect (discussed 
-                    <E T="03">infra</E>

-                    The Exchange also proposes a non-substantive change to Rule 11.12(a)(4) to provide that an order is being modified by a Replace Message rather than cancelled and replaced with a new order. This change is intended to provide that an order does not need to be cancelled and replaced with a new order, but rather includes modifications to orders via the use of a Replace Message. The proposed changes to Exchange Rule 11.12(a)(4) are based on previously-approved changes to MIAX Pearl Rule 2616(a)(5), which is substantially similar to Exchange Rule 11.12(a)(4).

-                    In the event that a User requests an order modification using a Replace Message, the System will first determine whether the modification is of a kind that may result in a loss of time priority in order to determine how the modification will be handled by the System. For example, as noted in Exchange Rule 11.12(a)(4), a modification to the price of an order will cause the loss of time priority. Therefore, in the event of a modification of the price of an order, the System will first determine that the type of modification may result in a loss of time priority and then handle the order accordingly by giving it a new timestamp.

-                     Since an order modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may result in a change in price of the order when an SSCB is in effect, the Exchange immediately gives the order a new timestamp. As previously discussed, a modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or a modification from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) requires the System to determine whether an order must be re-priced to be compliant with the requirements of Regulation SHO. The Exchange notes, however, that an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) does not require the System to determine whether the order shall be re-priced as a result of the modification, as both a sell long and a sell short exempt order may execute at a more aggressive price than a sell short order when an SSCB is in effect. Given that the System does not have to evaluate whether a price change is required as part of an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa), this specific order modification does not lose priority on the BYX Book.

-                         Alternatively, as noted in Rule 11.12(a)(4) a modification that involves a decrease in the size of the order will not cause the loss of time priority. Therefore, in order to decrease the size of the order, the System will first determine that the type of modification will not result in a loss of time priority and will handle the order in a completely different manner than it would if the order would have resulted in a loss of time priority.

-                    Specifically, if a sell long order is modified to a sell short order (or vice versa) or a sell short exempt order is modified to a sell short order (or vice versa) while an SSCB is in effect, the Exchange cannot simply change the order from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) while resting on the book, but rather must verify that the sell short order would not violate Rule 201(b)(1)(ii)

-                     of Regulation SHO before the order is re-added to the BYX Book. Therefore, as such a modification may result in a change of the order's price, the System gives the order a new timestamp, resulting in a loss of priority. Similarly, if a sell short order is modified to a sell long order (or vice versa) or a sell short order is modified to a sell short exempt (or vice versa) order while an SSCB is in effect, the order may be eligible to display at a more aggressive price. As such, the System gives the order a new timestamp, again resulting in a loss of time priority, but potentially in improved price priority. However, if an order is modified from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) when an SSCB is in effect, the System does not have to take an additional step to evaluate whether the modification violates Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO given that sell long and sell short exempt orders may execute at more aggressive prices that sell short orders during an SSCB. Accordingly, an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) would not result in a loss of priority. Stated differently, the System treats orders marked sell long and sell short exempt the same, and only order modifications from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) would cause an order to lose priority during an SSCB because the System is required to determine whether a change in the order's price is required as a consequence of the change in status from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa). This order price analysis by the System is required in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO as orders may be required to be re-priced to prevent potential violations of Rule 201 when the SSCB is in effect.

-                    <SU>15</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     in a given covered security 
-                    <SU>16</SU>
-                    <FTREF/>
-                     is $5.00 × $5.10 while an 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13220"/>
-                    SSCB is in effect. A User enters a non-displayed sell long order with a limit price of $5.00. Subsequently, the User modifies the position of the order from sell long to sell short, while the NBBO has remained the same. In order to effect the modification, the System determines that a modification from sell long to sell short may result in a change in the order's price in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, as orders may be required to be repriced to prevent potential violations of Rule 201 when the SSCB is in effect. Accordingly, the order loses its time priority in order for the System to handle the potential price change. In this example, the subject order resulted in a change of the order's price as the sell short order was not eligible for execution at a price equal to the NBB. Nonetheless, even if the modification would not have ultimately resulted in a price change, the modification would have necessarily caused the System to evaluate whether a price change was necessary and, thus, required a new timestamp, resulting in a loss of time priority.

-                    In particular, the proposed rule change to Rule 11.9(e)(3) is consistent with the protection of investors and the 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13221"/>
-                    public interest because it aligns the rule text with the how the System currently operates and helps to eliminate any potential confusion Users may have regarding current Rule 11.9(e)(3). This proposed amendment will not change existing System behavior and Users will have more certainty about how orders may be modified, which is related to the proposed changes to Rule 11.12(a)(4).
-                </P>
-                <P>Additionally, the proposed rule change to Rule 11.12(a)(4) is designed to ensure all sell short orders are subjected to the Exchange's process for ensuring that the order would not violate Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO during an SSCB. In order to verify the displayed price of an order with a position modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB, the System handles the modification as if a price change would occur, even if the modification does not ultimately result in a price change. If the System permitted such order modifications to forego this process, no order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB would result in a loss of time priority, and as a result, certain sell short orders could be permitted to display or execute at an impermissible price that would not comply with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii). The Exchange's process is designed to ensure compliance with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO and is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. As designed, during an SSCB, the System determines up front whether an order modification could result in a price change before it can properly effect the modification. If the modification is of a type that may result in a price change to comply with Regulation SHO, the System gives the order a new timestamp. As a result, such a modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) always results in a loss of time priority even if the modification did not result in a change of the order's price. Conversely, an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) does not result in an order losing priority because the System does not conduct an order price analysis to ensure compliance with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO as both sell long and sell short exempt orders may execute at more aggressive prices than sell short orders during an SSCB.</P>
-                <P>
-                    Moreover, the Exchange processes billions of order modifications each month, with only a limited amount of modifications involving a change from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB. Out of the billions of order modifications processed by the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges during the months of May, June, and July 2022, the Exchange identified approximately 369,884 order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) across the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges during an SSCB that would potentially be affected by the proposed amendment to Rule 11.12(a)(4).

-                    <FTREF/>
-                     Given that 369,884 order modifications during an SSCB across the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges is an extremely small percentage of the billions of order modifications that the Cboe affiliated equity exchanges processed during the months of May, June, and July 2022, the Exchange believes that any benefit from restoring priority to this limited amount of order modifications is outweighed by the burden of changing the System to be able to conduct an order price analysis in real time to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO and to permit these orders to retain priority.

Instead, the proposed change provides clarity to Users that a position change from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may be accomplished through the use of a Replace Message and does not require an order to be cancelled and a new order submitted in order to modify an order's position to sell short exempt. The proposed change to Rule 11.9(e)(3) will also provide continuity between Rule 11.9(e)(3) and the proposed changes to Rule 11.12(a)(4), and as such are directly intended to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and national market system.</P>

-                    The proposed change to Rule 11.12(a)(4) removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because it addresses a limited scenario when a User modifies an order's position using a Replace Message during an SSCB. The proposed rule change specifically states that orders whose positions are modified from either sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using a Replace Message when an SSCB is not in effect will not receive a new timestamp and will not lose priority as compared to other orders on the BYX Book. Further, the proposed rule change provides that order modifications from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) using a Replace Message will not lose priority as 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13222"/>
-                    compared to other orders on the BYX Book, regardless of whether an SSCB is in effect. Additionally, the proposed change to Rule 11.12(a)(4) removes impediments to and perfects a free and open market system because it is designed to make clear to Users that orders may be modified using a Replace Message without losing priority subject to the limitations named in Rule 11.12(a)(4). This change does not amend the meaning or operation of Rule 11.12(a)(4).
-                </P>
-                <P>The proposed changes to Rule 11.13(b)(1) are designed to provide that any sell short order that will post to an away Trading Center will be routed when an SSCB is in effect. In addition, providing Users the ability to send sell short orders that will post to an away Trading Center, and thus are routable when an SSCB is in effect provides them additional flexibility with regard to the handling of their orders, and may provide additional execution opportunities for those orders. Given this, the proposed amendments to Rule 11.13(b)(1) are directly targeted at removing impediments to and perfecting the mechanism of a free and open market and national market system, as well as to assure fair competition among brokers and dealers and among exchange markets.</P>
-                <P>The proposed change to Rule 11.13(b)(1) further promotes just and equitable principles of trade and perfects a free and open market system by identifying which orders containing routing instructions are eligible to route and post to an away market center during an SSCB. As all Trading Centers are required to comply with Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, a User can expect that an order routed from the Exchange to an away market center will be treated similarly on the away market center as it would on the Exchange during an SSCB. There is no change to the meaning or operation of this rule, but rather an amendment to make clear that an order that is eligible to post to an away market may be routed during an SSCB. In addition, correcting an inadvertent reference to the Exchange's affiliate promotes just and equitable principles of trade by correctly identifying the Exchange within the rule text without changing the meaning or operation of the rule.</P>
-                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
-                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act as the proposed rule changes are not being proposed for competitive reasons. Rather, the proposed amendment to Rule 11.9(e)(3) provides that modifications from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) may be accomplished through the use of a Replace Message. This proposed amendment will not change existing System behavior and Users will have more certainty about how orders may be modified, which is related to the proposed changes to Rule 11.12(a)(4). Order modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) use the same Replace Message functionality as a modification from either sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa), and amending Rule 11.9(e)(3) to describe this behavior for Users is directly related to the Exchange's proposed changes to Rule 11.12(a)(4) and does not impose a burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act.</P>
-                <P>Additionally, the proposed amendments to Rule 11.12(a)(4) will enhance the transparency of the rules by revising the rule text. By revising the rule text to align with the current System behavior, Users will be aware that if they modify their orders from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) and an SSCB is in effect, their orders will be given a new timestamp and lose time priority. Users are free to consider this proposed change as part of their overall experience with the Exchange, which also includes execution quality and functionality offerings, when making order routing decisions. Additionally, the Exchange notes that the proposed rule change applies equally to all Users, and all Users' orders are subject to the described functionality, regardless of their size. Users may not opt-out of this System functionality.</P>
-                <P>Furthermore, this loss of time priority for a position modification would only occur when an SSCB is in effect and the Exchange is required to comply with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO. The impact of an order modification from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) using a Replace Message during an SSCB with respect to loss of time priority is no different than when a User seeks to increase the size of their order using a Replace Message or when a User seeks to change the position of their order by cancelling the existing order and entering a new order. In each instance, the order will receive a new timestamp reflecting the time the modification was made and the order would lose priority as compared to other orders on the BYX Book.</P>
-                <P>
-                    Furthermore, the proposed change to Rule 11.12(a)(4) does not impose any burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act in that the proposed change does not present a novel approach to sell short order handling. Indeed, the proposed changes to Rule 11.12(a)(4) are consistent with a recently approved amendment

The Exchange's proposed Rule is also similar to MIAX Pearl Rule 2616(a) in that modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) and modifications from sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) will be subject to a loss of priority during an SSCB.

The Exchange's System does not view an order modification from sell long to sell short exempt (or vice versa) as a type of change which requires an order price analysis in order to prevent potential violations of Rule 201(b)(1)(ii) of Regulation SHO, and as such does not cause these types of order modifications to result in a loss of priority.</P>

-                     In each instance mentioned above, the original order would need to be replaced with a new order and therefore would receive a new timestamp which would result in a loss of priority. The Exchange is seeking to only append a new timestamp and cause a loss of priority as compared to other orders on the BYX Book when an order's position is modified from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) during an SSCB, which is more narrowly-tailored than the rules governing similar order behavior on MIAX Pearl, IEX and Nasdaq.

-                <P>Furthermore, the proposed change to Rule 11.13(b)(1) does not impose any burden on inter-market competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act as it makes clear that orders that may post to away market centers will be routed during an SSCB. Users will have the ability to take this factor into consideration when determining which routing strategy to use when entering an order on the Exchange and are able to consider this proposed change as part of their overall experience with the Exchange. If a User disfavors this proposed change they are free to use a different routing strategy or submit an order directly to an away market center. This proposed change is not being proposed for competitive reasons, but rather to make clear that any order eligible to be posted to an away market center will be routed during an SSCB. As each market center is required to comply with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO, the Exchange believes that any order eligible to be posted to an away market center should be permitted to route, as the order would be subject to the away market center's rules regarding compliance with Rule 201 of Regulation SHO upon posting. The proposed change to correct an inadvertent reference to the Exchange's affiliate is similarly not proposed for competitive reasons, but rather in order to ensure that the rule correctly identifies the Exchange within the rule text.</P>

In addition, Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii) requires a self-regulatory organization to give the Commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change, along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change, at least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time as designated by the Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this requirement.

-                    A proposed rule change filed under Rule 19b–4(f)(6) normally does not become operative prior to 30 days after the date of the filing. However, pursuant to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),

-                     the Commission may designate a shorter time if such action is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. The Exchange has asked the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay. The Exchange states the proposed rule change provides clarity on how orders modified to sell short exempt are accomplished and the priority of orders marked sell short exempt. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change related to modifications from sell long to sell short (or vice versa) or sell short exempt to sell short (or vice versa) that occur during an SSCB will affect only a small percentage of overall order modifications.

-                     Finally, the Exchange states that the proposed change to Rule 11.11(a) will permit orders containing routing instructions entered by all Users that would post to an away market during an SSCB to route to away market centers immediately upon becoming operative. The Commission believes that waiver of the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest because the proposed rule change does not raise any new or novel issues. Accordingly, the Commission hereby waives the operative delay and designates the proposal operative upon filing.

-                <P>By petition filed on December 13, 2022, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF) requests that the Board partially revoke the trackage rights exemption granted to it under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7) in Docket No. FD 36377 (Sub-No. 6), as necessary to permit that trackage rights arrangement to expire at midnight on December 31, 2023.</P>
-                <P>
-                    As explained by BNSF in its verified notice of exemption in Docket No. FD 36377 (Sub-No. 6), BNSF and Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP) entered into an agreement granting BNSF restricted, local trackage rights over two rail lines owned by UP between: (1) UP milepost 93.2 at Stockton, Cal., on UP's Oakland Subdivision, and UP milepost 219.4 at Elsey, Cal., on UP's Canyon Subdivision, a distance of 126.2 miles; and (2) UP milepost 219.4 at Elsey, and UP milepost 280.7 at Keddie, Cal., on UP's Canyon Subdivision, a distance of 61.3 miles (collectively, the Lines).

-                     FD 36377 (Sub-No. 6). BNSF further stated that the trackage rights arrangement is intended to permit BNSF to move empty and loaded unit ballast trains to and from the ballast pit located at Elsey. 
-                    <E T="03">Id.</E>
-                     According to BNSF, it filed its verified notice of exemption under the Board's class exemption procedures at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7), instead of 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(8), because the trackage rights covered by the notice are local rather than overhead rights.

-                    In its petition, BNSF asks the Board to partially revoke the exemption as necessary to permit the trackage rights to expire at midnight on December 31, 2023, pursuant to the parties' agreement. (

-                     FD 36377 (Sub-No. 6). BNSF argues that granting this petition will promote the rail transportation policy at 49 U.S.C. 10101 and that the partial revocation would be consistent with the limited scope of the transaction and would not have an adverse effect on shippers. (BNSF Pet. 3.) In addition, BNSF asserts that the Board has granted similar petitions for partial revocation to permit temporary trackage rights to expire, including petitions involving prior iterations of the trackage rights agreement at issue here.

-                <P>
-                    Although BNSF and UP have expressly agreed on the duration of the proposed trackage rights agreement, trackage rights approved under the class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7) typically remain effective indefinitely, regardless of any contract provisions. At times, however, the Board has partially revoked a trackage rights exemption to allow those rights to expire after a limited time period rather than lasting in perpetuity.

-                     FD 36377 (Sub-No. 5) (STB served Feb. 7, 2022) (granting a petition to partially revoke a trackage rights exemption involving the Lines at issue in this case);

-                </P>
-                <P>
-                    Granting partial revocation in these circumstances to permit the trackage rights to expire at the end of 2023 would eliminate the need for BNSF to file a second pleading seeking discontinuance authority when the agreement expires, thereby promoting the aspects of the rail transportation policy at 49 U.S.C. 10101(2), (7), and (15). Moreover, partially revoking the exemption to limit the term of the trackage rights would have no adverse impact on shippers because the trackage rights at issue are solely to allow BNSF to move empty and loaded unit ballast trains to and from the ballast pit in Elsey for use in BNSF's maintenance-of-way projects. (

-                    The PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501–3520, and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, require Federal agencies to provide 60-days' notice to the public to allow comment on information collection activities before seeking OMB approval of the activities. 
-                    <E T="03">See</E>
-                     44 U.S.C. 3506, 3507; 5 CFR 1320.8–1320.12. Specifically, FRA invites interested parties to comment on the following ICR regarding: (1) whether the information collection activities are necessary for FRA to properly execute its functions, including whether the activities will have practical utility; (2) the accuracy of FRA's estimates of the burden of the information collection activities, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used to determine the estimates; (3) ways for FRA to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information being collected; and (4) ways for FRA to minimize the burden of information collection activities on the public, including the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology.

-                    FRA believes that soliciting public comment may reduce the administrative and paperwork burdens associated with the collection of information that Federal statutes and regulations mandate. In summary, FRA reasons that comments received will advance three objectives: (1) reduce reporting burdens; (2) organize information collection requirements in a “user-friendly” format to improve the use of such information; and (3) accurately assess the resources expended to retrieve and produce information requested.

-                    <E T="03">Abstract:</E>
-                     This collection of information is necessary to enable FRA to garner customer and stakeholder feedback in an efficient, timely manner, consistent with its commitment to improving service delivery. The information collected from FRA's customers and stakeholders will help ensure users have an effective, efficient, and satisfying experience with FRA's programs. This feedback will provide insights into customer and stakeholder perceptions, experiences and expectations, provide an early indicator of issues with service, and focus attention on areas where communication, training or changes in operations might improve delivery of products or services. This collection will allow ongoing, collaborative, and actionable communications between FRA and its customers and stakeholders. It also allows feedback to contribute directly to the improvement of program management. If this information is not collected, vital feedback from customers and stakeholders on FRA's services will be unavailable.
-                </P>
-                <P>Improving FRA's programs requires ongoing assessment of service delivery. FRA will collect, analyze, and interpret information gathered through this generic clearance to identify strengths and weaknesses of current services and make improvements to service delivery based on feedback. The solicitation of feedback will target areas such as: timeliness, appropriateness, information accuracy, courtesy, service delivery efficiency, and issue resolution. FRA will assess responses in order to plan and inform efforts seeking to improve the quality of service offered to the public.</P>
-                <P>FRA will only submit a collection for approval under this generic clearance under the following conditions:</P>
-                <P>• The information gathered is only used internally for general service improvement and program management purposes and is not intended for public release;</P>
-                <P>• The information gathered is not used to substantially inform significant policy decisions;</P>
-                <P>• The information gathered will yield qualitative information; FRA will not design the collection or expect it to yield statistically reliable results or use it as though the results are generalizable to the study population;</P>
-                <P>• Participation in the collection is voluntary;</P>
-                <P>• The collection is low-burden for respondents (based on considerations of total burden hours, total number of respondents, or burden-hours per respondent) and is low-cost for both the respondents and the Federal Government;</P>
-                <P>• The collection is non-controversial and does not raise issues of concern to other Federal agencies;</P>
-                <P>• The collection is directed to the solicitation of opinions from respondents who have experience with the OMB program or may have experience with the OMB program soon after receiving the collection; and</P>
-                <P>• With the exception of information needed to provide remuneration for focus group participants and cognitive laboratory studies, personally identifiable information (PII) is collected only to the extent necessary and is not retained by FRA.</P>
-                <P>FRA increased the estimated paperwork burden by 121 hours, from 354 hours (current inventory) to 4475 hours (requesting inventory). The increased burden is due to changes in FRA's organizational structure and additional interactions with stakeholders as a result of continued implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act statutorily required programs.</P>

-                     The Building American Production Capacity for Electric Port Equipment and other Port Infrastructure Items collection is essential to identify the demand for electrically powered port equipment and infrastructure items supported by pooled procurement. This initiative, which is comprised of an online survey and interview with diverse American port stakeholders, will also support Buy American/Buy America objectives and American manufacturers of electrically powered port equipment. Survey responses will also help to identify a suitable port through which the procurement of electrically powered port equipment and infrastructure can be initiated. This survey is being conducted through a cooperative agreement between the Maritime Administration (MARAD) and the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA).

-                    Currently, many U.S. port authorities and marine terminal operators purchase diesel-powered dockside equipment, necessary for loading, unloading, and organizing shipping containers. Much of this equipment is foreign made, in short supply, and increases exposure to 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13227"/>
-                    dangerous emissions that contribute to climate change. The recent passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), commonly referred to as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which was signed into law on November 15, 2021, provides a federal grant stream that will modernize U.S. ports infrastructure over the next five years. Specifically, this Bill assures resources for the development of a domestic capacity of clean electric-powered American alternatives to replace and reduce emissions by predominantly foreign-made diesel port equipment.

Applicants must include in their application that they will provide or coordinate the provision of the baseline mental health screening to all participants aged 18 and over. In addition, the application must include the proposed suicide prevention services to be provided or coordinated to be provided and the identified need for those services. Suicide prevention services include:

-                <P>
-                    <E T="03">Outreach to identify and engage eligible individuals (and their families) at highest risk of suicide:</E>
-                     Grantees providing or coordinating the provision of outreach must use their best efforts to ensure that eligible individuals, including those who are at highest risk of suicide or who are not receiving health care or other services furnished by VA, and their families are identified, engaged and provided suicide prevention services. Based on the suicide risk and eligibility screening conducted by grantees, eligible individuals who should be considered at highest risk of suicide are those with a recent suicide attempt, an active plan or preparatory behavior for suicide or a recent hospitalization for suicidality. VA will provide access to the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSR–S) to determine level of suicide risk. Outreach must include active liaison with local VA facilities; State, local, or tribal government (if any); and private agencies and organizations providing suicide prevention services to eligible individuals and their families in the area to be served by the grantee. This outreach can include, for example, local mental health and emergency or urgent care departments in local hospitals or clinics. Grantees are required to have a presence in the area to meet with individuals and organizations to create referral processes to the grantee and other community resources. VA requires that grantees coordinate with VA with respect to the provision of health care and other services to eligible individuals. VA expects that grantees will work with local VA facilities on a regular basis to coordinate care when needed for eligible individuals.

-                <P>
-                    <E T="03">Baseline mental health screening:</E>
-                     Grantees must provide or coordinate the provision of baseline mental health screenings to all participants aged 18 and over they serve at the time those services begin. This baseline mental health screening ensures that the participant's mental health needs can be properly determined and that suicide prevention services can be further tailored to meet the individual's needs. The baseline mental health screening must be provided using validated screening tools that assess suicide risk and mental and behavioral health conditions. VA will provide access to the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE), Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL–12), Socio Economic Status (SES) and the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS) to grantees providing or coordinating the provision of baseline mental health screenings.
-                </P>
-                <P>If an eligible individual is at risk of suicide or other mental or behavioral health condition pursuant to the baseline mental health screening, the grantee must refer such individual to VA for care. If the eligible individual refuses the grantee's referral to VA, any ongoing clinical services provided to the eligible individual by the grantee is at the expense of the grantee. It is important to note that this is only required for eligible individuals and not the family of eligible individuals.</P>
-                <P>If a participant other than an eligible individual is at risk of suicide or other mental or behavioral health condition pursuant to the baseline mental health screening, the grantee must refer such participant to appropriate health care services in the area. To the extent that the grantee is able to furnish such appropriate health care services on an ongoing basis and has available funding separate from funds provided under this grant program to do so, they would be able to furnish such services using those non-VA funds without being required to refer such participants to other services. As noted previously herein, any ongoing clinical services provided to the participant by the grantee is at the expense of the grantee.</P>
-                <P>When such referrals are made by grantees to VA, to the extent practicable, those referrals are required to be a “warm hand-off” to ensure that the eligible individual receives necessary care. This “warm hand-off” may include providing any necessary transportation to the nearest VA facility, assisting the eligible individual with scheduling an appointment with VA and any other similar activities that may be necessary to ensure the eligible individual receives necessary care in a timely manner.</P>

-                    <E T="03">Education:</E>
-                     Suicide prevention education programs may be provided and coordinated to be provided to educate communities, Veterans and families on how to identify those at risk 
-                    <PRTPAGE P="13231"/>
-                    of suicide, how and when to make referrals for care and the types of suicide prevention resources available within the area. Education can include gatekeeper training, lethal means safety training or specific education programs that assist with identification, assessment or prevention of suicide. Gatekeeper training generally refers to programs that seek to develop individuals' knowledge, attitudes and skills to prevent suicide. Gatekeeper training is an educational course designed to teach clinical and non-clinical professionals or gatekeepers the warning signs of a suicide crisis and how to respond and refer individuals for care. Education is important because learning the signs of suicide risk, how to reduce access to lethal means and to connect those at risk of suicide to care can improve understanding of suicide and has the potential to reduce suicide.

-                    <E T="03">Clinical services for emergency treatment:</E>
-                     Clinical services may be provided or coordinated to be provided for emergency treatment of a participant. Emergency treatment means medical services, professional services, ambulance services, ancillary care and medication (including a short course of medication related to and necessary for the treatment of the emergency condition that is provided directly to or prescribed for the patient for use after the emergency condition is stabilized and the patient is discharged) was rendered in a medical emergency of such nature that a prudent layperson would have reasonably expected that delay in seeking immediate medical attention would have been hazardous to life or health. This standard is met by an emergency medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) that a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine could reasonably expect the absence of the immediate medical assistance to result in placing the health of the individual in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. It is important to note that emergency medical conditions include emergency mental health conditions.
-                </P>
-                <P>If an eligible individual is furnished clinical services for emergency treatment and the grantee determines that the eligible individual requires ongoing services, the grantee must refer the eligible individual to VA for additional care. If the eligible individual refuses the grantee's referral to VA, any ongoing clinical services provided to the eligible individual by the grantee is at the expense of the grantee.</P>
-                <P>If a participant other than an eligible individual is furnished clinical services for emergency treatment and the grantee determines that the participant requires ongoing services, the grantee must refer the participant to appropriate health care services in the area for additional care. Except in instances in which a participant other than an eligible individual is furnished clinical services for emergency treatment, funds provided under this grant program may not be used to provide ongoing clinical services to such participants, and any ongoing clinical services provided to the participant by the grantee is at the expense of the grantee.</P>
-                <P>
-                    <E T="03">Case management services:</E>
-                     Case management services are focused on suicide prevention to effectively assist participants at risk of suicide. Grantees providing or coordinating the provision of case management services must provide or coordinate the provision of such services that include, at a minimum, (a) performing a careful assessment of participants, and developing and monitoring case plans in coordination with a formal assessment of suicide prevention services needed, including necessary follow-up activities, to ensure that the participant's needs are adequately addressed, (b) establishing linkages with appropriate agencies and service providers in the area to help participants obtain needed suicide prevention services, (c) providing referrals to participants and related activities (such as scheduling appointments for participants) to help participants obtain needed suicide prevention services, such as medical, social and educational assistance or other suicide prevention services to address participants' identified needs and goals, (d) deciding how resources and services are allocated to participants on the basis of need, (e) educating participants on issues, including, but not limited to, suicide prevention services' availability and participant rights and (f) other activities, as approved by VA, to serve the comprehensive needs of participants for the purpose of reducing suicide risk.

-                    <E T="03">Peer support services:</E>
-                     The coordination of peer support services by the grantee must be to help participants understand what resources and supports are available in their area for suicide prevention. Peer support services must be provided by Veterans trained in peer support with similar lived experiences related to suicide or mental health. Peer support specialists serve as role models and a resource to assist participants with their mental health recovery. Peer support specialists function as interdisciplinary team members, assisting physicians and other professional and non-professional personnel in a rehabilitation treatment program. Each grantee providing or coordinating the provision of peer support services must ensure that Veterans providing such services to participants meet the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 7402(b)(13) and meet qualification standards for appointment or have completed peer support training, are pursuing credentials to meet the minimum qualification standards for appointment and are under the supervision of an individual who meets the necessary requirements of 38 U.S.C. 7402(b)(13).
-                </P>
-                <P>Qualification standards include that the individual is (1) a Veteran who has recovered or is recovering from a mental health condition and (2) certified by (i) a not-for-profit entity engaged in peer support specialist training as having met such criteria as the Secretary shall establish for a peer support specialist position or (ii) a State as having satisfied relevant State requirements for a peer support specialist position. VA has further set forth qualifications for its peer support specialists in VA Handbook 5005, Staffing (last updated September 30, 2021). Grant funds may be used to provide education and training for employees of the grantee or the community partner who provide peer support services based on the terms set forth in the grant agreement.</P>

-                    <E T="03">Assistance in obtaining VA benefits:</E>
-                     The provision of this assistance will provide grantees with additional means by which VA can notify participants of available VA benefits. Grantees assisting participants in obtaining VA benefits are required to aid participants in obtaining any benefits from VA for which the participants are eligible. Such benefits include but are not limited to (1) vocational and rehabilitation counseling, (2) supportive services for homeless Veterans, (3) employment and training services, (4) educational assistance and (5) health care services. Grantees are not permitted to represent participants before VA with respect to a claim for VA benefits unless they are recognized for that purpose pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 5902. Employees and members of grantees are not permitted to provide such representation unless the individual providing representation is accredited pursuant to 38 U.S.C. chapter 59.

-                    <PRTPAGE P="13232"/>
-                    needs are required to assist participants in obtaining and coordinating the provision of benefits that are being provided by Federal, State, local or Tribal agencies, or any other grantee in the area served by the grantee by referring the participant to and coordinating with such entity. If a public benefit is not being provided by Federal, State, local, or Tribal agencies, or any other grantee in the area, the grantee is not required to obtain, coordinate or provide such public benefit. Public benefits and assistance that a participant may be referred to include health care services, which include (1) health insurance and (2) referrals to a governmental entity or grantee that provides (i) hospital care, nursing home care, outpatient care, mental health care, preventive care, habilitative and rehabilitative care, case management, respite care, home care, (ii) the training of any eligible individual's family in the care of any eligible individual and (iii) the provision of pharmaceuticals, supplies, equipment, devices, appliances and assistive technology. Grantees also may refer participants, as appropriate, to an entity that provides daily living services relating to the functions or tasks for self-care usually performed in the normal course of a day. Grantees may refer or provide directly personal financial planning services; transportation services; temporary income support services (including, among other services, food assistance and housing assistance); fiduciary and representative payee services; legal services to assist eligible individuals with issues that may contribute to the risk of suicide; and the provision of childcare. For additional details on these elements, applicants may consult 38 CFR 78.80.

-                     Grantees may provide or coordinate the provision of nontraditional and innovative approaches and treatment, including but not limited to complementary or alternative interventions with some evidence for effectiveness of improving mental health or mitigating a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behavior. Applicants may propose nontraditional and innovative approaches and treatment practices in their suicide prevention services grant applications. VA is exercising its authority by reserving the right to approve or disapprove nontraditional and innovative approaches and treatment practices to be provided or coordinated to be provided using funds authorized under SSG Fox SPGP.

-                     Grantees may provide general suicide prevention assistance, which may include payment directly to a third party (and not to a participant or their family), in an amount not to exceed $750 per participant during any 1-year period, beginning on the date that the grantee first submits a payment to a third party. Expenses that may be paid include expenses associated with gaining or keeping employment, such as uniforms, tools, certificates and licenses, as well as expenses associated with lethal means safety and secure storage, such as gun locks and locked medication storage.

-                    <E T="03">G. Guidance For The Use of VA Suicide Prevention Grant Funds:</E>
-                     Consistent with section 201(o) of the Act, only grantees that are a State or local government or an Indian Tribe can use grant funds to enter into an agreement with a community partner under which the grantee may provide funds to the community partner for the provision of services to eligible individuals and their families. However, grantees may choose to enter into contracts for goods or services because in some situations, resources may be more readily available at a lower cost, or they may only be available from another party in the community.
-                </P>
-                <P>Grantees may make payments directly to a third party on behalf of a participant for childcare, transportation, and general suicide prevention assistance. Funds can be used to conduct outreach, educate and connect with eligible individuals who are not engaged with VA services. Any outreach and education that is funded by SSG Fox SPGP should link directly back to a referral to the grantee's program for an opportunity to enroll the eligible individual in the program.</P>
-                <P>Funds must be used to screen for eligibility and suicide risk and enroll individuals in the program accordingly. Note that some individuals who come through the referral process may not engage in services. Grantees are expected to determine what referrals are appropriate for these individuals for follow up services. Funds must be used to coordinate and provide suicide prevention services, by the grantee, based on screening and assessment, including clinical services for emergency treatment.</P>
-                <P>Funds also must be used to evaluate outcomes and effectiveness related to suicide prevention services. Prior to providing suicide prevention services, grantees must verify, document and classify each participant's eligibility for suicide prevention services. Grantees must determine and document each participant's degree of risk of suicide using tools identified in the suicide prevention services grant agreement. Prior to services ending, grantees must provide or coordinate the provision of a mental health screening to all participants aged 18 or over they serve, when possible. This screening must be conducted with the same tools used to conduct the initial baseline mental health screening. Having this screening occur at the beginning and prior to services ending is important in evaluating the effectiveness of the services provided.</P>
-                <P>Grantees must document the suicide prevention services provided or coordinated, how such services are provided or coordinated, the duration of the services provided or coordinated and any goals for the provision or coordination of such services. If the eligible individual wishes to enroll in VA health care, the grantee must inform the eligible individual of a VA point of contact for assistance with enrollment.</P>
-                <P>For each participant aged 18 and over, grantees must develop and document an individualized plan with respect to the provision of suicide prevention services provided. This plan must be developed in consultation with the participant.</P>
-                <P>As outlined in 38 CFR 78.105, activities for which grantees will not be authorized to use suicide prevention services grant funds include direct cash assistance to participants and their families; those legal services prohibited pursuant to § 78.80(g); medical or dental care and medicines except for clinical services for emergency treatment authorized pursuant to § 78.6; and any activities considered illegal under Federal law, and any costs identified as unallowable per 2 CFR part 200, subpart E.</P>

If chosen, this methodology once elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as a non-Federal entity chooses to negotiate for a rate, which the non-Federal entity may apply to do at any time.</P>

This action is necessary to establish harvest limits for groundfish during the remainder of the 2023 and the start of the 2024 fishing years and to accomplish the goals and objectives of the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP). The 2023 harvest specifications supersede those previously set in the final 2022 and 2023 harvest specifications, and the 2024 harvest specifications will be superseded in early 2024 when the final 2024 and 2025 harvest specifications are published.

Section 679.20(c)(1) further requires that NMFS publish and solicit public comment on proposed annual TACs and apportionments thereof, Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits, and seasonal allowances of pollock and Pacific cod. Upon consideration of public comment received under § 679.20(c)(1), NMFS must publish a notification of final harvest specifications for up to 2 fishing years as annual TACs and apportionments, Pacific halibut PSC limits, and seasonal allowances of pollock and Pacific cod, per § 679.20(c)(3)(ii). The final harvest specifications set forth in Tables 1 through 27 of this rule reflect the outcome of this process, as required at § 679.20(c).</P>

In December 2022, NMFS consulted with the Council regarding the 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications. After considering public comment at public meetings, as well as biological and socioeconomic data that were available at the Council's December 2022 meeting, NMFS is implementing the final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications, as recommended by the Council. For 2023, the sum of the TAC amounts is 468,796 mt. For 2024, the sum of the TAC amounts is 476,537 mt.

-                    <P>On November 23, 2022, NMFS published a proposed rule (87 FR 71559) to implement Amendment 112 to the FMP, which, if approved, would allow jig gear as an authorized fishing gear type in the GOA sablefish Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) fisheries. The Council's intent in recommending Amendment 112 is to increase entry-level opportunities and increase flexibility for IFQ holders. This is because jig gear is a smaller investment than other gear types and does not require significant vessel retrofits as with other gear. Additionally, jig gear is already an authorized gear type for the harvest of halibut IFQ and this action would further align the authorized gear types in the halibut and sablefish IFQ fisheries. Additionally, the proposed rule includes a variety of other provisions, which, if approved, would revise regulations associated with requirements or exemptions for the use of collapsible pot gear. It would also revise regulatory specifications for gear marking, pot limits, and other pot use restrictions in the GOA. Further details are available in the proposed rule to implement Amendment 112. If the FMP amendment and its implementing regulations are approved by the Secretary of Commerce, the action is anticipated to be effective for the 2023 IFQ season.</P>

-                    <P>
-                        NMFS is developing a proposed rule to implement Amendment 122 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI), which, if approved, would establish the Pacific Cod Trawl Cooperative Program (PCTC Program) to allocate BSAI Pacific cod harvest quota to qualifying groundfish License Limitation Program (LLP) license holders and qualifying processors. The PCTC Program would be a limited access privilege program (LAPP) for the harvest of Pacific cod in the BSAI trawl catcher vessel (CV) sector. One of the elements of the proposed PCTC Program is to revise the GOA groundfish sideboard limits and halibut PSC limits for LLP licenses that receive allocations of PCTC quota share. The Program would change the American Fisheries Act (AFA) non-exempt GOA groundfish sideboard and halibut PSC limits for all

-                        In December 2022, the Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC), its Advisory Panel (AP), and the Council reviewed the most recent biological and harvest information about the condition of the GOA groundfish stocks. The Council's GOA Groundfish Plan Team (Plan Team) compiled and presented this information in the 2022 SAFE report for the GOA groundfish fisheries, dated November 2022 (see 
-                        <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
-                        ). The SAFE report contains a review of the latest scientific analyses and estimates of each species' biomass and other biological parameters, as well as summaries of the available information on the GOA ecosystem and the economic condition of the groundfish fisheries off Alaska. From these data and analyses, the Plan Team recommends, and the SSC sets, an overfishing level (OFL) and ABC for each species and species group. The 2022 SAFE report was made available for public review during the public comment period for the proposed harvest specifications.
-                    </P>
-                    <P>In previous years, the greatest changes from the proposed to the final harvest specifications have been based on recent NMFS stock surveys, which provide updated estimates of stock biomass and spatial distribution, and changes to the models used for producing stock assessments. At the November 2022 Plan Team meeting, NMFS scientists presented updated and new survey results, changes to stock assessment models, and accompanying stock assessment estimates for groundfish species and species groups that are included in the 2022 SAFE report per the stock assessment schedule found in the 2022 SAFE report introduction. The SSC reviewed this information at the December 2022 Council meeting. Changes from the proposed to the final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications are discussed below.</P>
-                    <P>The final 2023 and 2024 OFLs and ABCs are based on the best available biological information, including projected biomass trends, information on assumed distribution of stock biomass, and revised methods used to calculate stock biomass, and the final 2023 and 2024 TACs are based on the best available biological and socioeconomic information. The FMP specifies the formulas, or tiers, to be used to compute OFLs and ABCs. The formulas applicable to a particular stock or stock complex are determined by the level of reliable information available to fisheries scientists. This information is categorized into a successive series of six tiers to define OFL and ABC amounts, with Tier 1 representing the highest level of information quality available and Tier 6 representing the lowest level of information quality available. The Plan Team used the FMP tier structure to calculate OFL and ABC amounts for each groundfish species. The SSC adopted the final 2023 and 2024 OFLs and ABCs recommended by the Plan Team.</P>
-                    <P>The Council adopted the SSC's OFLs and ABCs and the AP's TAC recommendations. The final TAC recommendations are based on the ABCs and are adjusted for other biological and socioeconomic considerations, including maintaining the sum of all TACs within the required OY range of 116,000 to 800,000 mt.</P>
-                    <P>The Council recommended 2023 and 2024 TACs that are equal to ABCs for pollock in the Southeast Outside (SEO) District, sablefish, shallow-water flatfish in the Central GOA and the West Yakutat and SEO Districts, deep-water flatfish, rex sole, arrowtooth flounder in the Central GOA and the West Yakutat District, flathead sole in the Central GOA and the West Yakutat and SEO Districts, Pacific ocean perch (a rockfish species), northern rockfish, shortraker rockfish, dusky rockfish, rougheye and blackspotted rockfish, demersal shelf rockfish, thornyhead rockfish, “other rockfish” in the Western/Central GOA and West Yakutat District, big skate, longnose skate, other skates, sharks, and octopuses in the GOA. The Council recommended TACs for 2023 and 2024 that are less than the ABCs for pollock for the combined Western and Central GOA and West Yakutat District area, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish in the Western GOA, arrowtooth flounder in the Western GOA and the SEO District, flathead sole in the Western GOA, Atka mackerel, and “other rockfish” in the SEO District.</P>
-                    <P>The combined Western, Central, and West Yakutat pollock TAC and the GOA Pacific cod TACs are set to accommodate the State of Alaska's (State's) guideline harvest levels (GHLs) so that the ABCs for pollock and Pacific cod are not exceeded. The Western GOA shallow-water flatfish, Western GOA arrowtooth flounder, and Western GOA flathead sole TACs are set to allow for increased harvest opportunities for these target species while conserving the halibut PSC limit for use in other, more fully utilized fisheries. Similarly, the SEO District arrowtooth flounder TAC is set lower than ABC to conserve halibut PSC limit for use in other fisheries or because there is limited commercial interest and participation in this fishery. The Atka mackerel TAC is set to accommodate incidental catch amounts in other fisheries. The “other rockfish” TAC in the SEO District is set to reduce the amount of discards of the species in that complex.</P>
-                    <P>
-                        The final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications approved by the Secretary of Commerce are unchanged from those recommended by the Council, and are consistent with the preferred harvest strategy alternative outlined in the FMP and EIS (see

NMFS also finds that the Council's recommendations for TACs are consistent with the biological condition of groundfish stocks as adjusted for other biological and socioeconomic considerations, including maintaining the sum of all TACs within the OY range. NMFS reviewed the Council's recommended TACs and apportionments, and NMFS approves these harvest specifications under 50 CFR 679.20(c)(3)(ii).

The 2023 harvest specifications set in this final action supersede the 2023 harvest specifications previously set in the final 2022 and 2023 harvest specifications (87 FR 11599, March 2, 2022). The 2024 harvest specifications will be superseded in early 2024 when the final 2024 and 2025 harvest specifications are published. Pursuant to this final action, the 2023 harvest specifications therefore will apply for the remainder of the current year (2023), while the 2024 harvest specifications are projected only for the following year (2024) and will be superseded in early 2024 by the final 2024 and 2025 harvest specifications. Because this final action (published in early 2023) will be superseded in early 2024 by the

-                    <P>NMFS's apportionment of groundfish species is based on the distribution of biomass among the regulatory areas over which NMFS manages the species. Additional regulations govern the apportionment of pollock, Pacific cod, and sablefish and are described below.</P>
-                    <P>The ABC for the pollock stock in the combined Western and Central Regulatory Areas and the West Yakutat (WYK) District of the Eastern Regulatory Area (the W/C/WYK) includes the amount for the GHL established by the State for the Prince William Sound (PWS) pollock fishery. The Plan Team, SSC, AP, and Council have recommended that the sum of all State waters and Federal waters pollock removals from the GOA not exceed ABC recommendations. For 2023 and 2024, the SSC recommended and the Council approved the W/C/WYK pollock ABC, including the amount to account for the State's PWS GHL. At the November 2022 Plan Team meeting, State fisheries managers recommended setting the PWS pollock GHL at 2.5 percent of the annual W/C/WYK pollock ABC. For 2023, this yields a PWS pollock GHL of 3,723 mt, an increase of 396 mt from the 2022 PWS pollock GHL of 3,327 mt. For 2024, the PWS pollock GHL is 4,027 mt, an increase of 700 mt from the 2022 PWS pollock GHL of 3,327 mt. After the GHL reductions, the 2023 and 2024 pollock ABCs for the combined W/C/WYK areas are then apportioned between four statistical areas (Areas 610, 620, 630, and 640) as both ABCs and TACs, as described below and detailed in Tables 1 and 2. The total ABCs and TACs for the four statistical areas, plus the State PWS GHL, do not exceed the combined W/C/WYK ABC.</P>
-                    <P>Apportionments of pollock to the W/C/WYK areas are considered to be “apportionments of annual catch limits (ACLs)” rather than “ABCs.” This more accurately reflects that such apportionments address management, rather than biological or conservation, concerns. In addition, apportionments of the ACL in this manner allow NMFS to balance any transfer of TAC among Areas 610, 620, and 630 pursuant to § 679.20(a)(5)(iv)(B) to ensure that the combined W/C/WYK ACL, ABC, and TAC are not exceeded.</P>
-                    <P>
-                        NMFS establishes pollock TACs in the Western (Area 610) and Central (Areas 620 and 630) Regulatory Areas and the West Yakutat (Area 640) and the SEO (Area 650) Districts of the GOA (see Tables 1 and 2). NMFS also establishes seasonal apportionments of the annual pollock TACs in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas of the GOA among Statistical Areas 610, 620, and 630. Additional detail on area apportionments and seasonal allowances is provided in the

-                    <P>The 2023 and 2024 Pacific cod TACs are set to accommodate the State's GHLs for Pacific cod in State waters in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas, as well as in PWS (in the Eastern Regulatory Area). The Plan Team, SSC, AP, and Council recommended that the sum of all State waters and Federal waters Pacific cod removals from the GOA not exceed ABC recommendations. The Council recommended setting the 2023 and 2024 Pacific cod TACs in the Western, Central, and Eastern Regulatory Areas to account for State GHLs. Therefore, the 2023 Pacific cod TACs are less than the ABCs by the following amounts: (1) Western GOA, 2,239 mt; (2) Central GOA, 3,708 mt; and (3) Eastern GOA, 585 mt. The 2024 Pacific cod TACs are less than the ABCs by the following amounts: (1) Western GOA, 2,062 mt; (2) Central GOA, 3,414 mt; and (3) Eastern GOA, 539 mt. These amounts reflect the State's 2023 and 2024 GHLs in these areas, which are 30 percent of the Western GOA ABC and 25 percent of the Eastern and Central GOA ABCs.</P>

-                        The Western and Central GOA Pacific cod TACs are allocated among various gear and operational sectors. NMFS also establishes seasonal apportionments of the annual Pacific cod TACs in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas.

At that time, the most recent stock assessment information was contained in the final 2021 SAFE report. The final 2022 SAFE report contains the best and most recent scientific information on the condition of the groundfish stocks, as previously discussed in this preamble, and is available for review (see

In the GOA, the total final 2023 TAC amount is 468,796 mt, an increase of 5.7 percent from the total proposed 2023 TAC amount of 443,615 mt. The total final 2024 TAC amount is 476,537 mt, an increase of 7.4 percent from the total proposed 2024 TAC amount of 443,615 mt. Table 1a summarizes the difference between the proposed and final TACs.

-                    <P>Annual stock assessments incorporate a variety of new or revised inputs, such as survey data or catch information, as well as changes to the statistical models used to estimate a species' biomass and population trend. Changes to biomass and ABC estimates are primarily based on fishery catch updates to species' assessment models. Some species, such as pollock and sablefish, have additional surveys conducted on an annual basis, which resulted in additional data being available for the 2022 assessments for these stocks.</P>

Based on changes in the estimates of overall biomass in the stock assessment for 2023 and 2024, as compared to the estimates previously made for 2022 and 2023, the species or species group with the greatest TAC percentage increases are pollock, flathead sole, dusky rockfish, and sharks. Based on changes in the estimates of biomass, the species or species group with the greatest TAC percentage decreases are Pacific cod, demersal shelf rockfish, and thornyhead rockfish. For all other species and species groups, changes from the proposed 2023 TACs to the final 2023 TACs and changes from the proposed 2024 TACs to the final 2024 TACs are less than a 10 percent change (either increase or decrease).

-                             The total for the W/C/WYK Regulatory Areas pollock ABC is 148,938 mt. After deducting 2.5 percent (3,723 mt) of that ABC for the State's pollock GHL fishery, the remaining pollock ABC of 145,215 mt (for the W/C/WYK Regulatory Areas) is apportioned among four statistical areas (Areas 610, 620, 630, and 640). These apportionments are considered subarea ACLs, rather than ABCs, for specification and reapportionment purposes. The ACLs in Areas 610, 620, and 630 are further divided by season, as detailed in Table 3 (final 2023 seasonal biomass distribution of pollock in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas, area apportionments, and seasonal allowances). In the West Yakutat (Area 640) and Southeast Outside (Area 650) Districts of the Eastern Regulatory Area, pollock is not divided into seasonal allowances.

Pacific cod TAC in the Eastern Regulatory Area of the GOA is allocated 90 percent to vessels harvesting Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component and 10 percent to vessels harvesting Pacific cod for processing by the offshore component. Table 5 lists the final 2023 Pacific cod seasonal apportionments and sector allocations.

-                             The total for the W/C/WYK Regulatory Areas pollock ABC is 161,080 mt. After deducting 2.5 percent (4,027 mt) of that ABC for the State's pollock GHL fishery, the remaining pollock ABC of 157,053 mt (for the W/C/WYK Regulatory Areas) is apportioned among four statistical areas (Areas 610, 620, 630, and 640). These apportionments are considered subarea ACLs, rather than ABCs, for specification and reapportionment purposes. The ACLs in Areas 610, 620, and 630 are further divided by season, as detailed in Table 4 (final 2024 seasonal biomass distribution of pollock in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas, area apportionments, and seasonal allowances). In the West Yakutat (Area 640) and Southeast Outside (Area 650) Districts of the Eastern Regulatory Area, pollock is not divided into seasonal allowances.

Pacific cod TAC in the Eastern Regulatory Area of the GOA is allocated 90 percent to vessels harvesting Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component and 10 percent to vessels harvesting Pacific cod for processing by the offshore component.

-                        Section 679.20(b)(2) requires NMFS to set aside 20 percent of each TAC for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish, sharks, and octopuses in reserve for possible apportionment at a later date during the fishing year. For 2023 and 2024, NMFS proposed reapportionment of all the reserves in the proposed 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications published in the 
-                        <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
-                         on December 2, 2022 (87 FR 74102). NMFS did not receive any public comments on the proposed reapportionments. For the final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications, NMFS reapportions, as proposed, all the reserves for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish, sharks, and octopuses back to the original TAC limit from which the reserve was derived (§ 679.20(b)(3)). This is being done because NMFS expects, based on recent harvest patterns, that such reserves are not necessary or that the entire TAC for each of these species will be caught. The TACs listed in Tables 1 and 2 reflect reapportionments of reserve amounts to the original TAC limit for these species and species groups,

-                    <P>In the GOA, pollock is apportioned by season and area, and is further allocated for processing by inshore and offshore components. The pollock TACs in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas of the GOA are apportioned among Statistical Areas 610, 620, and 630. These apportionments are divided into two equal seasonal allowances of 50 percent to the A season (January 20 through May 31) and 50 percent to the B season (September 1 through November 1) (§§ 679.20(a)(5)(iv)(B) and 679.23(d)(2)).</P>
-                    <P>
-                        Effective in 2021, regulatory changes revised the number of GOA pollock seasons to two seasons from four seasons (85 FR 38093, June 25, 2020). The GOA pollock stock assessment continues to use a four-season methodology to determine pollock distribution in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas of the GOA to maintain continuity in the historical pollock apportionment time-series. Pollock TACs in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas of the GOA are apportioned among Statistical Areas 610, 620, and 630 in proportion to the distribution of pollock biomass determined by the most recent NMFS surveys, pursuant to § 679.20(a)(5)(iv)(A). The pollock chapter of the 2022 SAFE report (see 
-                        <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
-                        ) contains a comprehensive description of the apportionment and reasons for the minor changes from past apportionments. For purposes of specifying pollock TAC between two seasons for the Western and Central Regulatory Areas of the GOA, NMFS has summed the A and B season apportionments and the C and D season apportionments, using the four-season methodology, as calculated in the 2022 GOA pollock assessment. This yields the seasonal amounts specified for the A season and the B season, respectively.
-                    </P>
-                    <P>Within any fishing year, the amount by which a pollock seasonal allowance is underharvested or overharvested may be added to, or subtracted from, the subsequent seasonal allowance for the Western and Central Regulatory Areas in a manner to be determined by the Regional Administrator (§ 679.20(a)(5)(iv)(B)). The rollover amount is limited to 20 percent of the subsequent seasonal TAC apportionment for the statistical area. Any unharvested pollock above the 20-percent limit could be further distributed to the other statistical areas, in proportion to the estimated biomass in the subsequent season in those statistical areas and in an amount no more than 20 percent of the seasonal TAC apportionment in those statistical areas (§ 679.20(a)(5)(iv)(B)). The pollock TACs in the WYK and the SEO Districts of 7,523 mt and 11,363 mt, respectively, in 2023, and 8,136 mt and 11,363 mt, respectively, in 2024, are not allocated by season.</P>
-                    <P>
-                        Tables 3 and 4 list the final 2023 and 2024 seasonal biomass distribution of pollock in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas, area apportionments, and seasonal allowances. The amounts of pollock for processing by the inshore and offshore components are not shown. Section 679.20(a)(6)(i) requires the allocation of 100 percent of the pollock TAC in all GOA regulatory areas and all seasonal allowances to vessels catching pollock for processing by the inshore component after subtraction of pollock amounts projected by the Regional Administrator to be caught by, or delivered to, the offshore component incidental to directed fishing for other groundfish species. Thus, the amount of pollock available for harvest by vessels harvesting pollock for processing by the offshore component is that amount that will be taken as incidental catch during directed fishing for groundfish species other than pollock, up to the maximum retainable amounts allowed by § 679.20(e) and (f). At this time, these incidental catch amounts of pollock are unknown and will be determined during the fishing year during the course of fishing activities by the offshore component.

In the Western and Central Regulatory Areas, a portion of the annual TAC is apportioned to the A season for hook-and-line, pot, and jig gear from January 1 through June 10, and for trawl gear from January 20 through June 10, and a portion of the annual TAC is apportioned to the B season for jig gear from June 10 through December 31, for hook-and-line and pot gear from September 1 through December 31, and for trawl gear from September 1 through November 1 (§§ 679.20(a)(12) and 679.23(d)(3)). NMFS also allocates the Pacific cod TACs annually between the inshore (90 percent) and offshore (10 percent) components in the Eastern Regulatory Area of the GOA (§ 679.20(a)(6)(ii)).</P>
-                    <P>In the Central GOA, the Pacific cod TAC is apportioned seasonally first to vessels using jig gear, and then among catcher vessels (CVs) less than 50 feet (15.2 meters (m)) in length overall using hook-and-line gear, CVs equal to or greater than 50 feet (15.2 m) in length overall using hook-and-line gear, catcher/processors (CPs) using hook-and-line gear, CVs using trawl gear, CPs using trawl gear, and vessels using pot gear (§ 679.20(a)(12)(i)(B)). In the Western GOA, the Pacific cod TAC is apportioned seasonally first to vessels using jig gear, and then among CVs using hook-and-line gear, CPs using hook-and-line gear, CVs using trawl gear, CPs using trawl gear, and vessels using pot gear (§ 679.20(a)(12)(i)(A)).

-                             Trawl catcher vessels participating in Rockfish Program cooperatives receive 3.81 percent, or 390 mt, of the annual Central GOA TAC, which is deducted from the Trawl CV B season allowance (see Table 13. Final 2024 Apportionments of Rockfish Secondary Species in the Central GOA and Table 28c to 50 CFR part 679).

-                    <P>Section 679.20(a)(4)(i) and (ii) require allocations of sablefish TACs for each of the regulatory areas and districts to fixed and trawl gear. In the Western and Central Regulatory Areas, 80 percent of each TAC is allocated to fixed gear, and 20 percent of each TAC is allocated to trawl gear. In the Eastern Regulatory Area, 95 percent of the TAC is allocated to fixed gear, and 5 percent is allocated to trawl gear. The trawl gear allocation in the Eastern Regulatory Area may only be used to support incidental catch of sablefish using trawl gear while directed fishing for other target species (§ 679.20(a)(4)(i)).</P>
-                    <P>In recognition of the prohibition against trawl gear in the SEO District of the Eastern Regulatory Area, the Council recommended, and NMFS approves, specifying for incidental catch the allocation of 5 percent of the combined Eastern Regulatory Area sablefish TAC to trawl gear in the WYK District of the Eastern Regulatory Area. The remainder of the WYK District sablefish TAC is allocated to vessels using fixed gear. NMFS allocates 100 percent of the sablefish TAC in the SEO District to vessels using fixed gear. This action results in 2023 allocations of 440 mt to trawl gear and 2,765 mt to fixed gear in the WYK District, a 2023 allocation of 5,602 mt to fixed gear in the SEO District, and a 2024 allocation of 383 mt to trawl gear in the WYK District. Table 7 lists the allocations of the 2023 sablefish TACs to fixed and trawl gear. Table 8 lists the allocations of the 2024 sablefish TACs to trawl gear.</P>
-                    <P>The Council recommended that a trawl sablefish TAC be established for 2 years so that retention of incidental catch of sablefish by trawl gear could commence in January in the second year of the groundfish harvest specifications. Both the 2023 and 2024 trawl allocations are specified in these final harvest specifications in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.</P>
-                    <P>The Council also recommended that the fixed gear sablefish TAC be established annually to ensure that this IFQ fishery is conducted concurrently with the halibut IFQ fishery and is based on the most recent survey information. Since there is an annual assessment for sablefish and since the final harvest specifications are expected to be published before the IFQ season begins in March 2023, the Council recommended that the fixed gear sablefish TAC be set annually, rather than for 2 years, so that the best scientific information available could be considered in establishing the sablefish TACs. Accordingly, Table 7 lists the 2023 fixed gear allocations, and the 2024 fixed gear allocations will be specified in the 2024 and 2025 harvest specifications.</P>
-                    <P>With the exception of the trawl allocations that are provided to the Rockfish Program (see Table 28c to 50 CFR part 679), directed fishing for sablefish with trawl gear in the GOA is closed during the fishing year. Also, fishing for groundfish with trawl gear is prohibited prior to January 20 (§ 679.23(c)). Therefore, it is not likely that the sablefish allocation to trawl gear will be reached before the effective date of these final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications.</P>

-                    <P>These final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications for the GOA include the fishery cooperative allocations and sideboard limitations established by the Rockfish Program. Rockfish Program participants are primarily trawl CVs and trawl CPs, with limited participation by vessels using longline gear. The Rockfish Program assigns quota share and cooperative quota to participants for primary species (Pacific ocean perch, northern rockfish, and dusky rockfish) and secondary species (Pacific cod, rougheye and blackspotted rockfish, sablefish, shortraker rockfish, and thornyhead rockfish), allows a participant holding a license limitation program (LLP) license with rockfish quota share to form a rockfish cooperative with other persons, and allows holders of CP LLP licenses to opt out of the fishery. The Rockfish Program also has an entry-level fishery for rockfish primary species for vessels using longline gear. Longline gear includes hook-and-line, jig, troll, and handline gear.</P>
-                    <P>
-                        Under the Rockfish Program, rockfish primary species in the Central GOA are allocated to participants after deducting for incidental catch needs in other directed groundfish fisheries (§ 679.81(a)(2)). Participants in the Rockfish Program also receive a portion of the Central GOA TAC of specific secondary species. In addition to groundfish species, the Rockfish Program allocates a portion of the halibut PSC limit (191 mt) from the third season deep-water species fishery allowance for the GOA trawl fisheries to Rockfish Program participants (§ 679.81(d) and Table 28d to 50 CFR part 679). The Rockfish Program also establishes sideboard limits to restrict the ability of harvesters operating under the Rockfish Program to increase their participation in other, non-Rockfish Program fisheries. These restrictions and halibut PSC limits are discussed in the

-                        Section 679.81(a)(2)(ii) and Table 28e to 50 CFR part 679 require allocations of 5 mt of Pacific ocean perch, 5 mt of northern rockfish, and 50 mt of dusky rockfish to the entry-level longline fishery in 2023 and 2024. The allocations for the entry-level longline fishery may increase incrementally each year if the catch in the previous year exceeds 90 percent of the allocation of a species. The incremental increase in the allocation would continue each year until it reaches the maximum percent of the TAC assigned to the Rockfish Program for that species. In 2022, the catch of Pacific ocean perch, northern rockfish, and dusky rockfish did not attain the 90 percent threshold, and the final allocations for 2023 therefore remain the same as the 2022 allocations. The remainder of the TACs for the rockfish primary species are allocated to the CV and CP cooperatives (§ 679.81(a)(2)(iii)). Table 9 lists the allocations of the 2023 and 2024 TACs for each rockfish primary species to the entry-level longline fishery, the potential incremental increases for future years, and the maximum percent of the TACs assigned to the Rockfish Program that may be allocated to the rockfish entry-level longline fishery.

-                    <P>Section 679.21(d) establishes annual halibut PSC limit apportionments to trawl gear and hook-and-line gear, and authorizes the establishment of apportionments for pot gear. In December 2022, the Council recommended and NMFS approves halibut PSC limits of 1,705 mt for trawl gear, 257 mt for hook-and-line gear, and 9 mt for the demersal shelf (DSR) rockfish fishery in the SEO District for both 2023 and 2024, consistent with § 679.21.</P>
-                    <P>The DSR fishery in the SEO District is defined at § 679.21(d)(2)(ii)(A). This fishery is apportioned 9 mt of the halibut PSC limit in recognition of its small-scale harvests of groundfish (§ 679.21(d)(2)(i)(A)). The separate halibut PSC limit for the DSR fishery is intended to prevent that fishery from being impacted from the halibut PSC incurred by other GOA fisheries. NMFS estimates low halibut bycatch in the DSR fishery because: (1) the duration of the DSR fishery and the gear soak times are short; (2) the DSR fishery occurs in the winter when there is less overlap in the distribution of DSR and halibut; and, (3) the directed commercial DSR fishery has a low DSR TAC. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game sets the commercial GHL for the DSR fishery after deducting estimates of DSR incidental catch in all fisheries (including halibut and subsistence) and allocation to the sport DSR fishery. In 2022, the commercial fishery for DSR was closed due to concerns about declining DSR biomass.</P>
-                    <P>The FMP authorizes the Council and NMFS to exempt specific gear from the halibut PSC limits. NMFS, after consultation with the Council, exempts pot gear, the sablefish IFQ fixed gear fishery categories, and jig gear from the non-trawl halibut PSC limit for 2023 and 2024. The Council recommended, and NMFS approves, these exemptions because: (1) the pot gear fisheries have low annual halibut bycatch mortality; (2) IFQ program regulations prohibit discard of halibut if any halibut IFQ permit holder on board a catcher vessel holds unused halibut IFQ for that vessel category and the IFQ regulatory area in which the vessel is operating (§ 679.7(f)(11)); (3) some sablefish IFQ fishermen hold halibut IFQ permits and are therefore required to retain the halibut they catch while fishing sablefish IFQ; and (4) NMFS estimates negligible halibut mortality for the jig gear fisheries given the small amount of groundfish harvested by jig gear, the selective nature of jig gear, and the high survival rates of halibut caught and released with jig gear.</P>
-                    <P>The best available information on estimated halibut bycatch consists of data collected by fisheries observers during 2022. The calculated halibut bycatch mortality through December 31, 2022, is 355 mt for trawl gear and 43 mt for hook-and-line gear for a total halibut mortality of 398 mt. This halibut mortality was calculated using groundfish and halibut catch data from the NMFS Alaska Region's catch accounting system. This accounting system contains historical and recent catch information compiled from each Alaska groundfish fishery.</P>

-                        Section 679.21(d)(4)(i) and (ii) authorize NMFS to seasonally apportion the halibut PSC limits after consultation with the Council. The FMP and regulations require that the Council and NMFS consider the following information in seasonally apportioning halibut PSC limits: (1) seasonal distribution of halibut; (2) seasonal distribution of target groundfish species relative to halibut distribution; (3) expected halibut bycatch needs on a seasonal basis relative to changes in halibut biomass and expected catch of target groundfish species; (4) expected bycatch rates on a seasonal basis; (5) expected changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons; (6) expected actual start of fishing effort; and (7) economic effects of establishing seasonal halibut allocations on segments of the target groundfish industry. The Council considered information from the 2022 SAFE report, NMFS catch data, State of Alaska catch data, International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) stock assessment and mortality data, and public testimony when apportioning the halibut PSC limits. NMFS concurs with the Council's recommendations listed in

-                             The Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit for hook-and-line gear is allocated to the DSR fishery in the SEO District and to the hook-and-line fisheries other than the DSR fishery. The fixed gear sablefish IFQ fishery is exempt from halibut PSC limits, as are pot and jig gear for all groundfish fisheries.

-                    <P>Section 679.21(d)(3)(ii) authorizes further apportionment of the trawl halibut PSC limit to trawl fishery categories listed in § 679.21(d)(3)(iii). The annual apportionments are based on each category's proportional share of the anticipated halibut bycatch mortality during the fishing year and optimization of the total amount of groundfish harvest under the halibut PSC limit. The fishery categories for the trawl halibut PSC limits are: (1) a deep-water species fishery, composed of sablefish, rockfish, deep-water flatfish, rex sole, and arrowtooth flounder; and (2) a shallow-water species fishery, composed of pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole, Atka mackerel, and “other species” (sharks and octopuses) (§ 679.21(d)(3)(iii)). Halibut mortality incurred while directed fishing for skates with trawl gear accrues towards the shallow-water species fishery halibut PSC limit (69 FR 26320, May 12, 2004).</P>
-                    <P>NMFS will combine available trawl halibut PSC limit apportionments during a portion of the second season deep-water and shallow-water species fisheries for use in either fishery from May 15 through June 30 (§ 679.21(d)(4)(iii)(D)). This is intended to maintain groundfish harvest while minimizing halibut bycatch by these sectors to the extent practicable. This provides the deep-water and shallow-water species trawl fisheries additional flexibility and the incentive to participate in fisheries at times of the year that may have lower halibut PSC rates relative to other times of the year.</P>
-                    <P>Table 15 lists the final 2023 and 2024 apportionments of trawl halibut PSC limits between the trawl gear deep-water and shallow-water species fishery categories.</P>
-                    <P>Table 28d to 50 CFR part 679 specifies the amount of the trawl halibut PSC limit that is assigned to the CV and CP sectors that are participating in the Rockfish Program. This includes 117 mt of halibut PSC limit to the CV sector and 74 mt of halibut PSC limit to the CP sector. These amounts are allocated from the trawl deep-water species fishery's halibut PSC third seasonal apportionment. After the combined CV and CP halibut PSC limit allocation of 191 mt to the Rockfish Program, 150 mt remains for the trawl deep-water species fishery's halibut PSC third seasonal apportionment.</P>
-                    <P>Section 679.21(d)(4)(iii)(B) limits the amount of the halibut PSC limit allocated to Rockfish Program participants that could be re-apportioned to the last seasonal apportionment for the general GOA trawl fisheries during the current fishing year to no more than 55 percent of the unused annual halibut PSC limit apportioned to Rockfish Program participants. The remainder of the unused Rockfish Program halibut PSC limit is unavailable for use by any person for the remainder of the fishing year (§ 679.21(d)(4)(iii)(C)).</P>

-                    <P>Section 679.21(d)(2)(i)(B) requires that the “other hook-and-line fishery” halibut PSC limit apportionment to vessels using hook-and-line gear must be apportioned between CVs and CPs in accordance with § 679.21(d)(2)(iii) in conjunction with these harvest specifications. A comprehensive description and example of the calculations necessary to apportion the “other hook-and-line fishery” halibut PSC limit between the hook-and-line CV and CP sectors were included in the proposed rule to implement Amendment 83 to the FMP (76 FR 44700, July 26, 2011) and are not repeated here.</P>
-                    <P>Pursuant to § 679.21(d)(2)(iii), the hook-and-line halibut PSC limit for the “other hook-and-line fishery” is apportioned between the CV and CP sectors in proportion to the total Western and Central GOA Pacific cod allocations, which vary annually based on the proportion of the Pacific cod biomass between the Western, Central, and Eastern GOA. Pacific cod is apportioned among these three management areas based on the percentage of overall biomass per area, as calculated in the 2022 Pacific cod stock assessment. Updated information in the final 2022 SAFE report describes this distributional calculation, which allocates ABC among GOA regulatory areas on the basis of the three most recent stock surveys. For 2023 and 2024, the distribution of the total GOA Pacific cod ABC is 29 percent to the Western GOA, 61 percent to the Central GOA, and 10 percent to the Eastern GOA. Therefore, the calculations made in accordance with § 679.21(d)(2)(iii) incorporate the most recent information on GOA Pacific cod distribution and allocations with respect to establishing the annual halibut PSC limits for the CV and CP hook-and-line sectors of the “other hook-and-line fishery.” Additionally, the annual halibut PSC limits for both the CV and CP sectors of the “other hook-and-line fishery” are divided into three seasonal apportionments, using seasonal percentages of 86 percent, 2 percent, and 12 percent.</P>
-                    <P>For 2023 and 2024, NMFS apportions halibut PSC limits of 150 mt and 107 mt to the hook-and-line CV and hook-and-line CP sectors, respectively. Table 16 lists the final 2023 and 2024 apportionments of halibut PSC limits between the hook-and-line CV and the hook-and-line CP sectors of the “other hook-and-line fishery.”</P>
-                    <P>No later than November 1 of each year, NMFS will calculate the projected unused amount of halibut PSC limit by either of the CV or CP hook-and-line sectors that comprise the two sectors of the “other hook-and-line fishery” for the remainder of the year.

-                        To monitor halibut bycatch mortality allowances and apportionments, the Regional Administrator uses observed halibut incidental catch rates, halibut discard mortality rates (DMRs), and estimates of groundfish catch to project when a fishery's halibut bycatch mortality allowance or seasonal apportionment is reached. Halibut

-                        incidental catch rates are based on observed estimates of halibut incidental catch in the groundfish fishery. DMRs are estimates of the proportion of incidentally caught halibut that do not survive after being returned to the sea. The cumulative halibut mortality that accrues to a particular halibut PSC limit is the product of a DMR multiplied by the estimated halibut PSC. DMRs are estimated using the best scientific information available in conjunction with the annual GOA stock assessment process. The DMR methodology and findings are included as an appendix to the annual GOA groundfish SAFE report.

-                        In 2016, the DMR estimation methodology underwent revisions per the Council's directive. An interagency halibut working group (IPHC, Council, and NMFS staff) developed improved estimation methods that have undergone review by the GOA Plan Team, SSC, and the Council. A summary of the revised methodology is contained in the GOA proposed 2017 and 2018 harvest specifications (81 FR 87881, December 6, 2016), and the comprehensive discussion of the working group's statistical methodology is available from the Council (see 
-                        <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
-                        ). The DMR working group's revised methodology is intended to improve estimation accuracy, transparency, and transferability in the methodology used for calculating DMRs. The working group will continue to consider improvements to the methodology used to calculate halibut mortality, including potential changes to the reference period (the period of data used for calculating the DMRs). The new methodology continues to ensure that NMFS is using DMRs that accurately reflect halibut mortality, which will inform the sectors of their estimated halibut mortality and allow sectors to respond with methods that could reduce mortality and, eventually, the DMR for that sector.

The final 2023 and 2024 DMRs in this rule are unchanged from the DMRs in the proposed 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications (87 FR 74102, December 2, 2022).

NMFS is required to close the directed pollock fishery in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas of the GOA if the applicable Chinook salmon PSC limit in that regulatory area will be reached (§ 679.21(h)(8)). The annual Chinook salmon PSC limits in the directed pollock fishery of 6,684 salmon in the Western GOA and 18,316 salmon in the Central GOA are set at § 679.21(h)(2).</P>
-                    <P>Amendment 97 to the FMP (79 FR 71350, December 2, 2014) established an initial annual PSC limit of 7,500 Chinook salmon for the trawl non-pollock groundfish fisheries in the Western and Central GOA. This limit is apportioned among the three sectors that conduct directed fishing for groundfish species other than pollock: 3,600 Chinook salmon to trawl CPs; 1,200 Chinook salmon to trawl CVs participating in the Rockfish Program; and 2,700 Chinook salmon to trawl CVs not participating in the Rockfish Program (§ 679.21(h)(4)). NMFS will monitor the Chinook salmon PSC in the trawl non-pollock groundfish fisheries and close an applicable sector if it will reach its Chinook salmon PSC limit.</P>
-                    <P>The Chinook salmon PSC limit for two sectors, trawl CPs and trawl CVs not participating in the Rockfish Program, may be increased in subsequent years based on the performance of these two sectors and their ability to minimize their use of their respective Chinook salmon PSC limits during a calendar year. If either or both of these two sectors limited its use of Chinook salmon PSC to a specified threshold amount in 2022 (3,120 for trawl CPs and 2,340 for Non-Rockfish Program trawl CVs), that sector will receive an incremental increase to its 2023 Chinook salmon PSC limit (§ 679.21(h)(4)). In 2022, the trawl CP sector did not exceed 3,120 Chinook salmon PSC; therefore, the 2023 trawl CP sector Chinook salmon PSC limit will be 4,080 Chinook salmon. In 2022, the Non-Rockfish Program trawl CV sector did not exceed 2,340 Chinook salmon PSC; therefore, the 2023 Non-Rockfish Program trawl CV sector Chinook salmon PSC limit will be 3,060 Chinook salmon.</P>

These sideboard limits are necessary to protect the interests of fishermen and processors who do not directly benefit from the AFA as compared to those fishermen and processors who receive exclusive harvesting and processing privileges under the AFA. Section 679.7(k)(1)(ii) prohibits listed AFA CPs and CPs designated on a listed AFA CP permit from harvesting any species of groundfish in the GOA.

Sideboard limits for non-exempt AFA CVs in the GOA are based on their traditional harvest levels of TAC in groundfish fisheries covered by the FMP. Section 679.64(b)(3)(iv) establishes the CV groundfish sideboard limitations in the GOA based on the aggregate retained catch of non-exempt AFA CVs of each sideboard species or species group from 1995 through 1997 divided by the sum of the TACs for that species or species group available to CVs over the same period. NMFS published a final rule (84 FR 2723, February 8, 2019) that implemented regulations to prohibit non-exempt AFA CVs from directed fishing for specific groundfish species or species groups subject to sideboard limits (§ 679.20(d)(1)(iv)(D) and Table 56 to 50 CFR part 679).

-                    <P>Section 680.22 establishes groundfish catch limits for vessels with a history of participation in the Bering Sea snow crab fishery to prevent these vessels from using the increased flexibility provided by the Crab Rationalization (CR) Program to expand their level of participation in the GOA groundfish fisheries. Sideboard limits restrict these vessels' catch to their collective historical landings in each GOA groundfish fishery (except the fixed-gear sablefish fishery). Sideboard limits also apply to catch made using an LLP license derived from the history of a restricted vessel, even if that LLP license is used on another vessel.</P>

-                    <P>The Rockfish Program establishes three classes of sideboard provisions: CV groundfish sideboard restrictions, CP rockfish sideboard restrictions, and CP opt-out vessel sideboard restrictions (§ 679.82(c)(1)). These sideboards are intended to limit the ability of rockfish harvesters to expand into other GOA groundfish fisheries.</P>
-                    <P>CVs participating in the Rockfish Program may not participate in directed fishing for dusky rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and northern rockfish in the West Yakutat District and Western GOA from July 1 through July 31. Also, CVs may not participate in directed fishing for arrowtooth flounder, deep-water flatfish, and rex sole in the GOA from July 1 through July 31 (§ 679.82(d)).</P>
-                    <P>CPs participating in Rockfish Program cooperatives are restricted by rockfish and halibut PSC sideboard limits. These CPs are prohibited from directed fishing for dusky rockfish, Pacific ocean perch, and northern rockfish in the West Yakutat District and Western GOA from July 1 through July 31 (§ 679.82(e)(2)). Prior to 2021, CPs participating in Rockfish Program cooperatives were restricted by rockfish sideboard limits in the Western GOA. A final rule that implemented Amendment 111 to the FMP (86 FR 11895, March 1, 2021) removed from regulation the Western GOA rockfish sideboard limits for Rockfish Program CPs. That rule also revised and clarified the establishment of the West Yakutat District rockfish sideboard ratios in regulation. The rockfish sideboard ratio for each rockfish fishery in the West Yakutat District is an established percentage of the TAC for catcher/processors in the directed fishery for dusky rockfish and Pacific ocean perch (§ 679.82(e)(4)). These percentages are confidential.</P>
-                    <P>Holders of CP-designated LLP licenses that opt out of participating in a Rockfish Program cooperative will be able to access that portion of each rockfish sideboard limit that is not assigned to rockfish cooperatives (§ 679.82(e)(7)).</P>
-                    <P>
-                        Under the Rockfish Program, the CP sector is subject to halibut PSC sideboard limits for the trawl deep-water and shallow-water species fisheries (§ 679.82(e)(3) and (5)). Halibut PSC sideboard ratios by fishery are set forth in § 679.82(e)(5). The CP sector halibut PSC sideboard limits are in effective from July 1 through July 31 (§ 679.82(e)(6)). No halibut PSC sideboard limits apply to the CV sector, as CVs participating in cooperatives receive a portion of the annual halibut PSC limit. CPs that opt out of the Rockfish Program are able to access that portion of the deep-water and shallow-water species fishery halibut PSC sideboard limit not assigned to CP rockfish cooperatives. The sideboard provisions for CPs that elect to opt out of participating in a rockfish cooperative are described in § 679.82(c), (e), and (f). Sideboard limits are linked to the catch history of specific vessels, however, some of these vessels may choose to opt out of the Rockfish Program. After March 1, NMFS will determine which CPs have opted-out of the Rockfish Program in 2023, and NMFS will know the ratios and amounts used to calculate opt-out sideboard ratios. NMFS will then calculate any applicable opt-out

-                        The halibut PSC sideboard limits for Amendment 80 Program vessels in the GOA are based on the historic use of halibut PSC by Amendment 80 Program vessels in each PSC target category from 1998 through 2004. These values are slightly lower than the average historic use to accommodate two factors: allocation of halibut PSC cooperative quota under the Rockfish Program and the exemption of the F/V

These tables incorporate the maximum percentages of the halibut PSC sideboard limits that may be used by Amendment 80 Program vessels as contained in Table 38 to 50 CFR part 679.

-                        NMFS prepared an EIS for the Alaska groundfish harvest specifications and alternative harvest strategies (see 
-                        <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
-                        ) and made it available to the public on January 12, 2007 (72 FR 1512). On February 13, 2007, NMFS issued the ROD for the EIS. In January-February 2023, NMFS prepared a SIR for this action to provide a subsequent assessment of the action and to address the need to prepare a Supplemental EIS (SEIS; 40 CFR 1501.11(b); § 1502.9(d)(1)). Copies of the EIS, ROD, and annual SIRs for this action are available from NMFS (see 
-                        <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
-                        ). The Final EIS analyzes the environmental, social, and economic consequences of the groundfish harvest specifications and alternative harvest strategies on resources in the action area. Based on the analysis in the Final EIS, NMFS concluded that the preferred Alternative (Alternative 2) provides the best balance among relevant environmental, social, and economic considerations and allows for continued management of the groundfish fisheries based on the most recent, best scientific information. The preferred alternative is a harvest strategy in which TACs are set at a level within the range of ABCs recommended by the Council's SSC; the sum of the TACs must achieve the OY specified in the FMP. While the specific numbers that the harvest strategy produces may vary from year to year, the methodology used for the preferred harvest strategy remains constant.

-                        The annual SIR evaluates the need to prepare a SEIS for the 2023 and 2024 groundfish harvest specifications. An SEIS must be prepared if (1) the agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns; or (2) significant new circumstances or information exist relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts (40 CFR 1502.9(d)(1)). After reviewing the information contained in the SIR and SAFE report, the Regional Administrator has determined that (1) approval of the 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications, which were set according to the preferred harvest strategy in the EIS, does not constitute a substantial 
-                        <PRTPAGE P="13262"/>
-                        change in the action; and (2) there are no significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the action or its impacts. The 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications will result in environmental, social, and economic impacts within the scope of those analyzed and disclosed in the EIS. Therefore, a SEIS is not necessary to implement the 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications.

-                    <P>Section 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 604) requires that, when an agency promulgates a final rule under 5 U.S.C. 553, after being required by that section or any other law, to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking, the agency shall prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA). The following constitutes the FRFA prepared for these final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications.</P>
-                    <P>Section 604 of the RFA describes the required contents of a FRFA: (1) a statement of the need for, and objectives of, the rule; (2) a statement of the significant issues raised by the public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA), a statement of the assessment of the agency of such issues, and a statement of any changes made in the proposed rule as a result of such comments; (3) the response of the agency to any comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in response to the proposed rule, and a detailed statement of any change made to the proposed rule in the final rule as a result of the comments; (4) a description of and an estimate of the number of small entities to which the rule will apply or an explanation of why no such estimate is available; (5) a description of the projected reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements of the rule, including an estimate of the classes of small entities which will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record; and (6) a description of the steps the agency has taken to minimize the significant economic impact on small entities consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, including a statement of the factual, policy, and legal reasons for selecting the alternative adopted in the final rule and why each one of the other significant alternatives to the rule considered by the agency that affect the impact on small entities was rejected.</P>
-                    <P>A description of this action, its purpose, and its legal basis are contained at the beginning of the preamble to this final rule and are not repeated here.</P>
-                    <P>NMFS published the proposed rule on December 2, 2022 (87 FR 74102). NMFS prepared an IRFA to accompany the proposed action, and included the IRFA in the proposed rule. The comment period closed on January 3, 2023. No comments were received on the IRFA or on the economic impacts of the rule more generally. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration did not file any comments on the proposed rule.</P>
-                    <P>The entities directly regulated by this action are: (1) entities operating vessels with groundfish Federal fishing permits (FFPs) catching FMP groundfish in Federal waters; (2) all entities operating vessels, regardless of whether they hold groundfish FFPs, catching FMP groundfish in the State-waters parallel fisheries; and (3) all entities operating vessels fishing for halibut inside 3 miles (5.6 km) of the shore (whether or not they have FFPs).</P>
-                    <P>For RFA purposes only, NMFS has established a small business size standard for businesses, including their affiliates, whose primary industry is commercial fishing (see 50 CFR 200.2). A business primarily engaged in commercial fishing (NAICS code 11411) is classified as a small business if it is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in its field of operation (including its affiliates), and has combined annual gross receipts not in excess of $11 million for all its affiliated operations worldwide.</P>
-                    <P>Using the most recent data available (2021), the estimated number of directly regulated small entities includes approximately 671 individual catcher vessel and CP entities with gross revenues meeting the small entity criteria. This includes an estimated 668 small CV entities and 3 small CP entities in the GOA groundfish sector. The determination of entity size is based on vessel revenues and affiliated group revenues. This determination also includes an assessment of fisheries cooperative affiliations, although actual vessel ownership affiliations have not been completely established. However, the estimate of these 671 CVs and CPs may be an overstatement of the number of small entities because of the complexity of analyzing the linkages and affiliations across these vessels, particularly since many of them conduct operations in Federal and State fisheries. The CVs had average gross revenues that varied by gear type. Average gross revenues for hook-and-line CVs, pot gear CVs, and trawl gear CVs are estimated to be $390,000, $720,000, and $1.96 million, respectively. Average gross revenues for CP entities are confidential.</P>
-                    <P>This final rule contains no information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.</P>
-                    <P>This action implements the final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications, apportionments, and halibut PSC limits for the groundfish fishery of the GOA. This action is necessary to establish harvest limits for groundfish during the 2023 and 2024 fishing years and is taken in accordance with the FMP prepared by the Council pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Act. The establishment of the final harvest specifications is governed by the Council's harvest strategy for the catch of groundfish in the GOA. The harvest strategy was selected previously from among five alternatives, with the preferred alternative harvest strategy being one in which the TACs fall within the range of ABCs recommended by the SSC. Under this preferred alternative harvest strategy, TACs are set within the range of ABCs recommended by the SSC; the sum of the TACs must achieve the OY specified in the FMP; and while the specific TAC numbers that the harvest strategy produces may vary from year to year, the methodology used for the preferred harvest strategy remains constant. This final action implements the preferred alternative harvest strategy previously chosen by the Council to set TACs that fall within the range of ABCs recommended through the Council harvest specifications process and as recommended by the Council. This is the method for determining TACs that has been used in the past.</P>
-                    <P>The final 2023 and 2024 TACs associated with preferred harvest strategy are those recommended by the Council in December 2022. OFLs and ABCs for the species were based on recommendations prepared by the Council's Plan Team, and reviewed by the Council's SSC. The Council based its TAC recommendations on those of its AP, which were consistent with the SSC's OFL and ABC recommendations. The sum of all TACs remains within the OY for the GOA consistent with § 679.20(a)(1)(i)(B).</P>
-                    <P>
-                        The final 2023 and 2024 OFLs and ABCs are based on the best available biological information, including projected biomass trends, information on assumed distribution of stock biomass, and revised technical methods to calculate stock biomass. The final 2023 and 2024 TACs are based on the best available biological and socioeconomic information. The final 2023 and 2024 OFLs, ABCs, and TACs are consistent with the biological 
-                        <PRTPAGE P="13263"/>
-                        condition of groundfish stocks as described in the 2022 SAFE report, which is the most recent, completed SAFE report. Accounting for the most recent biological information to set the final OFLs, ABCs, and TACs is consistent with the objectives for this action, as well as National Standard 2 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1851(a)(2)) that actions shall be based on the best scientific information available.
-                    </P>
-                    <P>Under this action, the final ABCs reflect harvest amounts that are less than the specified overfishing levels. The final TACs are within the range of final ABCs recommended by the SSC and do not exceed the biological limits recommended by the SSC (the ABCs and overfishing levels). For most species and species groups in the GOA, the Council recommended, and NMFS sets, final TACs equal to final ABCs, which is intended to maximize harvest opportunities in the GOA, unless other conservation or management reasons support setting TAC amounts less than the ABCs.</P>
-                    <P>For the following species and species groups, the Council recommended, and NMFS sets, TACs that are less than the ABCs: for pollock for the combined Western and Central GOA and West Yakutat District area; Pacific cod; shallow-water flatfish in the Western GOA; arrowtooth flounder in the Western GOA and the SEO District; flathead sole in the Western GOA, Atka mackerel; and “other rockfish” in the SEO District. These specific reductions were reviewed and recommended by the Council's AP, and the Council in turn adopted the AP's recommendations for the final 2023 and 2024 TACs.</P>
-                    <P>Increasing TACs for some species may not result in increased harvest opportunities for those species. This is due to a variety of reasons. There may be a lack of commercial or market interest in some species. Additionally, there are fixed, and therefore constraining, PSC limits associated with the harvest of the GOA groundfish species that can lead to an underharvest of flatfish TACs. For this reason, the shallow-water flatfish, arrowtooth flounder, and flathead sole TACs are set to allow for increased harvest opportunities for these target species while conserving the halibut PSC limit for use in other fisheries. Similarly, the SEO District arrowtooth flounder TAC is set lower than ABC to conserve halibut PSC limit for use in other fisheries or because there is limited commercial interest in this fishery. The Atka mackerel TAC is set to accommodate incidental catch amounts in other fisheries. The “other rockfish” TAC in the SEO District is set to reduce the amount of discards of the species in that complex. Finally, the TACs for two species (pollock and Pacific cod) cannot be set equal to ABC, as the TAC must be reduced to account for the State's GHLs in these fisheries. The W/C/WYK Regulatory Area pollock TAC and the GOA Pacific cod TACs are therefore set to account for the State's GHLs for the State waters pollock and Pacific cod fisheries so that the ABCs are not exceeded.</P>
-                    <P>Based upon the best available scientific data, and in consideration of the Council's objectives of this action, there are no significant alternatives to the final rule that have the potential to accomplish the stated objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and any other applicable statutes and that have the potential to minimize any significant adverse economic impact of the final rule on small entities. This action is economically beneficial to entities operating in the GOA, including small entities. The action specifies TACs for commercially valuable species in the GOA and allows for the continued prosecution of the fishery, thereby creating the opportunity for fishery revenue. After public process, during which the Council solicited input from stakeholders, the Council concluded that these final harvest specifications would best accomplish the stated objectives articulated in the preamble for this final rule and in applicable statutes and would minimize to the extent practicable adverse economic impacts on the universe of directly regulated small entities.</P>

-                        Adverse impacts on marine mammals, or endangered or threatened species, resulting from fishing activities conducted under this rule are discussed in the Final EIS and its accompanying annual SIRs (see

-                    <P>Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the date of effectiveness for this rule because delaying this rule is contrary to the public interest. The Plan Team review of the 2022 SAFE report occurred in November 2022, and, based on the 2022 SAFE report, the Council considered and recommended the final harvest specifications in December 2022. Accordingly, NMFS's review of the final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications could not begin until after the December 2022 Council meeting, and after the public had time to comment on the proposed action.</P>
-                    <P>For all fisheries not currently closed because the TACs established under the final 2022 and 2023 harvest specifications (87 FR 11599, March 2, 2022) have not yet been reached, it is possible that they would be closed prior to the expiration of a 30-day delayed effectiveness period, because those fisheries have nearly reached those previously set TACs. Some affected fisheries therefore could close soon, as they are already close to reaching their TACs, and such closures would cause unnecessary economic harm to the fisheries in the cases where this final rule increases some of the groundfish TACs. If implemented immediately, this final rule would allow these fisheries to continue fishing, because some of the new TACs implemented by this rule are higher than the TACs under which they are currently fishing.</P>
-                    <P>
-                        In addition, immediate effectiveness of this action is required to provide consistent management and conservation of fishery resources based on the best available scientific information. This is particularly pertinent for those species that have lower 2023 ABCs and TACs than those established in the 2022 and 2023 harvest specifications (87 FR 11599, March 2, 2022), including target species such as Pacific cod. If implemented immediately, this rule would ensure that NMFS can properly manage those fisheries for which this rule sets lower 2023 ABCs and TACs, which are based on the most recent biological information on the condition of stocks. The changes between the proposed 2023 ABCs and TACs are discussed earlier in the 
-                        <E T="03">Changes from the Proposed 2023 and 2024 Harvest Specifications in the GOA</E>

-                    </P>
-                    <P>
-                        Certain fisheries, such as those for pollock, are intensive, fast-paced fisheries. Other fisheries, such as those for sablefish, flatfish, rockfish, Atka mackerel, skates, sharks, and octopuses, are critical either as directed fisheries or as incidental catch in other fisheries. Thus, for those species that have higher 2023 TACs than under the final 2022 and 2023 harvest specifications (87 FR 11599, March 2, 2022) than the TACs established by this final rule, there is some risk of exceeding these TAC limits. U.S. fishing vessels have demonstrated the capacity to catch the TAC allocations in many of these fisheries. If the date of effectiveness of this rule were to be delayed 30 days and a TAC was reached during those 30 days, NMFS would be required to close directed fishing or prohibit retention for the applicable species. Such closures and unnecessary discards would cause confusion to the industry and potential economic harm to fishermen, undermining the intent of this rule. Waiving the 30-day delay in the date of effectiveness allows NMFS to prevent

-                        this potential economic harm that could occur, should the previously set 2023 TACs (as set under the 2022 and 2023 harvest specifications) be reached during such a delay. In addition, determining which fisheries may close in advance is nearly impossible because these fisheries are affected by several factors, including fishing effort, weather, movement of fishery stocks and market price, which cannot be predicted. Furthermore, the closure of one fishery has a cascading effect on other fisheries; the closure would free up fishing vessels, allowing them to move from closed fisheries to open fisheries, thereby increasing the fishing capacity in those open fisheries, and potentially causing them to close sooner.

-                    <P>In fisheries subject to declining sideboard limits, a failure to implement the updated sideboard limits before the initial season's end could deny the intended economic protection to the non-sideboarded sectors. Conversely, in fisheries with increasing sideboard limits, economic benefit could be denied to the sideboard-limited sectors.</P>
-                    <P>If the final harvest specifications are not effective by March 10, 2023, which is the start of the 2023 Pacific halibut season as specified by the IPHC, the fixed gear sablefish fishery will not begin concurrently with the Pacific halibut IFQ season. This would result in confusion for the industry and economic harm from unnecessary discard of sablefish that are caught along with Pacific halibut, as both fixed gear sablefish and Pacific halibut are managed under the same IFQ program. Immediate effectiveness of these final 2023 and 2024 harvest specifications will allow the sablefish IFQ fishery to begin concurrently with the Pacific halibut IFQ season.</P>
-                    <P>Finally, immediate effectiveness also provides the fishing industry the earliest possible opportunity to plan and conduct its fishing operations with respect to new information about TACs. Therefore, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), NMFS finds good cause to waive the 30-day delay in the date of effectiveness for this rule.</P>

-                    <HD SOURCE="HED">Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States</HD>
-                    <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
-                    <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
-                    <FP>1. On January 19, 2018, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) transmitted to the President a report on the Secretary's investigation into the effect of imports of aluminum articles on the national security of the United States under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862). The Secretary found and advised the President of his opinion that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States.</FP>
-                    <FP>2. In Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), the President concurred in the Secretary's finding that aluminum articles are being imported into the United States in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security of the United States, and decided to adjust the imports of aluminum articles by imposing a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on such articles imported from most countries.</FP>
-                    <FP>3. In Proclamation 9704, the President also directed the Secretary to monitor imports of aluminum articles and inform the President of any circumstances that in the Secretary's opinion might indicate the need for further action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, with respect to such imports.</FP>
-                    <FP>4. The Secretary has informed me that the capacity utilization in the domestic aluminum industry remains well below the target capacity utilization level recommended in the January 2018 report. The Secretary has also informed me that two of the five remaining aluminum smelters in the United States are in danger of closing as a result of continued high levels of aluminum imports and high energy prices.</FP>
-                    <FP>5. In the Secretary's January 2018 report, the Secretary recommended that the President consider applying a higher tariff to a list of specific countries should the President determine that all countries should not be subject to the same tariff. One of the countries on that list was the Russian Federation (Russia). As the Secretary explained in that report, Russia is among the major exporters of aluminum to the United States for domestic consumption. While aluminum imports from Russia have declined from the volume in the Secretary's 2018 report, Russia remains the fifth largest source of imported aluminum in the United States, and the imports of aluminum from Russia have increased in both 2021 and 2022. Distortions that result from overcapacity threaten market-oriented aluminum industries and Russia's aluminum industry in particular is extremely export oriented, with Russia being the largest exporter of unwrought aluminum in 2021 and Russian domestic consumption accounting for just 22 percent of Russian production across 2021 and 2022. United States imports of Russian aluminum increased by 53 percent between March and July 2022.</FP>
-                    <FP>
-                        6. Russia continues its unjustified, unprovoked, unyielding, and unconscionable war against Ukraine. The Russian aluminum industry is a key part of Russia's defense industrial base and has played a major role in supplying Russia with weapons and ammunition used in the war. In addition, Russia's 
-                        <PRTPAGE P="13268"/>
-                        war against Ukraine has caused global energy prices to rise, causing direct harm to the United States aluminum industry.
-                    </FP>
-                    <FP>7. To further reduce imports of aluminum articles and increase domestic capacity utilization, I have determined that it is necessary and appropriate to impose:</FP>
-                    <P>(a) beginning on March 10, 2023, a 200 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles that are the product of Russia and derivative aluminum articles that are the product of Russia; and</P>
-                    <P>(b) beginning on April 10, 2023, a 200 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles where any amount of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the aluminum articles is smelted in Russia, or the aluminum articles are cast in Russia, and derivative aluminum articles where any amount of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the derivative aluminum articles is smelted in Russia, or the derivative aluminum articles are cast in Russia.</P>
-                    <P>(c) “Primary aluminum” is defined as new aluminum metal that is produced from alumina (or aluminum oxide) by the electrolytic Hall-Heroult process.</P>
-                    <FP>8. The Secretary has advised me that the tariff adjustment described in paragraph 7 of this proclamation will be a significant step toward ensuring the viability of the domestic aluminum industry.</FP>
-                    <FP>9. In adopting the tariff adjustment described in paragraph 7 of this proclamation, I recognize that concerns about aluminum imports from Russia and their impact on our national security are shared by other countries, and that we need to work together with our partners to ensure that the global market distortions caused by Russian aluminum articles do not distort our markets and threaten our national security. Any country that imposes a tariff of 200 percent or more on its imports of aluminum articles that are products of Russia may be exempt from the tariff imposed by this proclamation.</FP>
-                    <FP>10. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, authorizes the President to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives that are being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security.</FP>
-                    <FP>11. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
-                    <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>

-                <HD SOURCE="HED">Increasing Duties on Certain Articles From the Russian Federation</HD>
-                <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
-                <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
-                <FP>1. On April 8, 2022, I signed the Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act (19 U.S.C. 2434 note) (Suspending NTR Act). Section 3(a) of the Suspending NTR Act suspended nondiscriminatory tariff treatment for products of the Russian Federation and of the Republic of Belarus, and imposed the rates of duty set forth in column 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) on all products of the Russian Federation and of the Republic of Belarus, effective as of April 9, 2022. Section 3(b)(1) of the Suspending NTR Act provides that the President may proclaim increases in the column 2 rates of duty applicable to products of the Russian Federation and of the Republic of Belarus.</FP>
-                <FP>2. On April 8, 2022, I signed the Ending Importation of Russian Oil Act (22 U.S.C. 8923 note). Section 2 of the Ending Importation of Russian Oil Act prohibits imports of all products of the Russian Federation classified under chapter 27 of the HTSUS, in a manner consistent with any implementation actions issued under Executive Order 14066 of March 8, 2022.</FP>
-                <FP>3. In Executive Order 14066 of March 8, 2022, I prohibited, inter alia, the importation into the United States of the following products of Russian Federation origin: crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products.</FP>
-                <FP>4. In Executive Order 14068 of March 11, 2022, I prohibited, inter alia, the importation into the United States of the following products of Russian Federation origin: fish, seafood, and preparations thereof; alcoholic beverages; and non-industrial diamonds.</FP>
-                <FP>5. In Proclamation 10420 of June 27, 2022, I stated that I had determined that increasing the column 2 rates of duty to 35 percent ad valorem on certain products of the Russian Federation was warranted and consistent with the foreign policy interests of the United States. I also stated that the United States will monitor the implementation of the increased duties, and that I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.</FP>
-                <FP>
-                    6. In accordance with section 3(b)(1) of the Suspending NTR Act, I have determined that increasing the column 2 rates of duty to 35 percent ad valorem on certain additional products of the Russian Federation and to 70 percent ad valorem on certain other additional products of the Russian Federation, the importation of which has not already been prohibited, is warranted and consistent with the foreign policy interests of the United States. In addition, I have determined that increasing the column 2 rates of duty from 35 percent ad valorem to 70 percent ad valorem on certain products covered by Proclamation 10420 of June 27, 2022, the importation of which has not already been prohibited, is warranted and consistent with the foreign policy interests of the United States. These products are listed in the Annex to this proclamation. The United States will monitor the implementation of the increased duties, and I may revisit this determination, as appropriate.

-                <FP>7. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTSUS the substance of statutes affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.</FP>
-                <FP>NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 3 of the Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act; section 301 of title 3, United States Code; and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:</FP>
-                <P>(1) To increase the column 2 rates of duty on imports of certain articles of the Russian Federation as set forth in paragraph 6 of this proclamation, subdivision (b) to U.S. Note 30 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS is modified and new HTSUS heading 9903.90.09 and new subdivisions (c) and (d) to U.S. Note 30 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTSUS are established, as provided for in the Annex to this proclamation.</P>

-                <P>(3) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.</P>

-                    <FP>On March 6, 2014, by Executive Order 13660, the President declared a national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701–1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets.</FP>
-                    <FP>On March 16, 2014, the President issued Executive Order 13661, which expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, and found that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation with respect to Ukraine undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets.</FP>
-                    <FP>On March 20, 2014, the President issued Executive Order 13662, which further expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, as expanded in scope in Executive Order 13661, and found that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation, including its purported annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine, continue to undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets.</FP>
-                    <FP>On December 19, 2014, the President issued Executive Order 13685, to take additional steps to address the Russian occupation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.</FP>
-                    <FP>On September 20, 2018, the President issued Executive Order 13849, to take additional steps to implement certain statutory sanctions with respect to the Russian Federation.</FP>
-                    <FP>On February 21, 2022, the President issued Executive Order 14065, which further expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, as expanded in scope in Executive Orders 13661 and 13662, and relied on for additional steps taken in Executive Orders 13685 and 13849, and found that the Russian Federation's purported recognition of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic or Luhansk People's Republic regions of Ukraine contradicts Russia's commitments under the Minsk agreements and further threatens the peace, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.</FP>
-                    <FP>
-                        The actions and policies addressed in these Executive Orders continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, which was expanded in scope in Executive Order 13661, Executive Order 13662, and Executive Order 14065, and under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13685 and Executive Order 13849, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2023.
