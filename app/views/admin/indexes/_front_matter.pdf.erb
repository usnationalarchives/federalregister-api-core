      <strong>THIS INDEX</strong> is based on a consolidation of contents entries appearing
      in the <%= date_description_without_year %> subject references. The entries are arranged
      first under the name of the agency which issued the document. Under
      each agency, the entries are then listed alphabetically within the
      categories of Rules, Proposed Rules, and Notices. Executive Orders,
      Proclamations, and other documents from the President are listed
      under Presidential Documents. Each entry contains the page number
      in the  <strong>Federal Register</strong> where the document begins,
      followed by the date it was published. This index
      is published monthly and is cumulated for 12 months.
