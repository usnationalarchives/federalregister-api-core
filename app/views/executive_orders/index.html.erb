  <h1>Executive Orders</h1>
  <hr />

  <p>
    The President of the United States manages the operations of the Executive branch of Government through Executive orders. After the President signs an Executive order, the White House sends it to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR). 
    The OFR numbers each order consecutively as part of a series, and publishes it in the daily Federal Register shortly after receipt.
  </p>

  <p>Executive orders issued since 1994 are available as a single bulk download and as a bulk download by President, or you can browse by President and year from the list below. More details about our APIs can be found on our <a href="/learn/developers">developers page</a>.</p>
